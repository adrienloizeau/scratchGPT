{"text": "Is the usual contract writing style being questioned and a radically new one proposed?\nAs someone who is not a lawyer and needs to sign contracts, I often find the conventional writing style as an instrument to justify the inclusion of clauses that represent a client/provider relationship as if it actually were a master/slave one. This is noticeable in cases where a small company intends to sell its services to a bigger one. In my experience, the language used in these writings acts as a protection for imbalance, as if the \"master\" were allowed to pretend that an otherwise abusive clause is just regular jargon. At the same time, this accepted language seems to indicate that its author (a lawyer) is more interested in creating the conditions that would favor a conflict, rather than assisting the parties in avoiding them.\n\n\nMy question is whether there exists any serious new framework, guidelines or proposal for writing contracts in a way that avoids verbal aggression, underlying instead the spirit of collaboration and commitment that a client/provider agreement should protect. I'm asking this question because I would like to learn of a valid alternative that I could propose to the other party.\n\n\nFinally, note that I'm not asking why things are the way they are.

So, according to this standard videogame medium considered a whole piece and even a small portion of that piece, even if it makes not sense outside of the whole or bears no value (copyrightable value i.e. creative and original content) is protected?\n\n\nLet's take, for example, a typical videogame that is made on a generic-purpose videogame engine such as Unreal Engine 4 or Unity3D Engine. When the game is packaged as a final product it contains a lot of stuff that is fairly easy to determine as protected and copyrighted work: audio assets (music, sound effects), graphical assets (textures, sprites, etc), other visual assets (3D models aka meshes, protected design-wise) and so on. This packaged game is our **videogame medium**. But along with this game, a bunch of meta-data is packaged as well. This metadata has no possible copyrightable value by definition (and can be actually considered as a \"fact\" or \"factual data\") and it does not even belong to the IP holder/wonder but rather, in some way, to the creators of the tools itself (Unreal Engine, for example). Let say all this data is in one single file that is being shared - how would copyright law protect against this kind of sharing?\n\n\nFor the context, this is somewhat follow-up to [Can digital signature/Hash sequence be copyrighted?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66668/can-digital-signature-hash-sequence-be-copyrighted/66669#66669)\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

However, what I wonder about is if some of the above logic does not also, then, apply to a situation like this: if one were to, given this fact, *falsely* announce on such a forum that one had committed a crime that one actually did not, could it amount to having the same effect of wasting prosecutor/law enforcement time albeit in a more indirect way that sneaks through their attitudes, and thus potentially also be considered some kind of crime?\n\n\n(I want to point out I'm not referring to making a false claim to be the perpetrator of a known crime, or to falsely claim someone else is that perpetrator to, say, get reward money.

{"text": "Does VII help employers oppress workers, or are there other laws that compensate?\nI am wondering whether an employer can hire two people under the same job title and pay but deny them equal working conditions. \n\n\nFor instance, it is common practice for Walmart to hire customer service associates under a vague job title, and thereafter assign more dangerous tasks (stocking heavy products) to the more physically capable associates and the safer tasks (stocking light products) to the less capable associates. \n\n\n***More detail in response to comments***\n\n\nThe jurisdiction in California. \n\n\nI am wondering if employees are protected by law if they refuse to perform the strenuous work because they've been assigned that task too much compared to others. For instance, let's say that Bob has had to spend 5 hours a week stocking the coolers and freezers and 10 hours a week stocking water for 2 years, while Adam who has the same job title as Bob has rarely had to perform such work in the same time period (assume less than 2% of total hours worked), instead Adam does the easier tasks such as stocking chips, cosmetics products, and diapers. The reason the employer provides for this allocation is that Bob is more physically capable of doing hard work. \n\n\nIt seems to me that in such a case, Bob is being mistreated. He deserves an equal share of the easier tasks as Adam, and if the employer wants Bob to do the hard work, they should create a separate job title for him that imposes higher qualifications that ensures that those under the same job title are able to share the work equally. \n\n\nBy denying Bob access to working conditions comparable to Adam's, the employer is essentially denying him a job for which he is overqualified. And in doing so, the employer is able to get Bob's more rare labor for the same price as Adam's less valuable labor. \n\n\nLet's also assume Bob and Adam belong to the same protected classes. \n\n\nAs I understand it, Title VII and FEHA do not protect Bob from refusing, since he belongs to all the same classes as Adam. \n\n\nThis doesn't make much sense to me because if the employer had divided the tasks along protected class lines (i.e., gender or race) rather than by physical ability, then Bob would be protected. \n\n\nThe irony that I've noticed is that the very laws that were passed to protect qualified workers from discrimination now excuse discrimination against qualified workers. \n\n\nAre there other laws that protect Bob from such discrimination that does not require a showing of discrimination based on protected class? Maybe an implied term in the employment contract?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

My question is only about this element in making a contract, not consideration or other elements.

Maybe that's the case only for medicine and some other professions and not for, say, home party hosts, although I think that could be answered by establishing, somehow, that the service provider's service is commercially valuable and deserving of compensation even if the provider is not classified as a professional.\n\n\nIn one case, a jury was persuaded by a photo of a handshake.

{"text": "Employer forcing everyone to sign new contract which significantly affects working hours\nMy employer has recently undergone a number of changes internally, involving the move to different premises (with the argument about the new building being larger, however will accommodate roughly the same number of staff as the current building will occupy). As part of this, they have sent around an update to the employment contract which basically nullifies the flexible working hours which previously has been in effect. Many people I work with vary their working hours to fit in with their lives, and has been accepted - up to this point.\n\n\nThe business operated a core working hours of 10am to 4pm, but are changing this to 9am - 5pm, with a 30 minute \"flexible start/end\" that employees can start and end their working day (e.g; 8.30am to 5pm, or 9am to 5.30pm) - effectively removing the concept of flexible working hours completely. This affects many people's lives, and some of my colleagues are petitioning to retain their flexible working hours, of which are being met with strict rules surrounding a mandatory lunch hour/half hour, no option to work less than this to make up the time (despite being willing to), and one has been forced to drop their hours to 36/week.\n\n\nThey also put in a clause to the portion that they're wanting everyone to sign which says that everyone must specify when, between the hours to 12pm to 2pm, they will take their lunch, and must be rigid over this (unless a meeting is occurring, in which case that overrides your lunch hour and you must take it later). This was also met with protest, and they eventually caved and relaxed this rigidity slightly, then sent across some minutes from that meeting ratifying this. They will not, however, update the contract to reflect this as they've said that the meeting minutes ratifies it. However, we don't believe this would ever stand up in court if a dispute ever arose. Is this true?\n\n\nThe final part of this demands flexibility from the employee for the business's requirements (e.g; if a meeting runs late/starts early, the employee is expected to be there), but will not offer the same level of flexibilities to staff who currently have lives (unless they offer a rigid, business-valid justification for doing so). It's almost as if they're \"offering\" this 30 minutes of flexibility to save face because on paper the revision is a load of rubbish.\n\n\nMany people do not want to sign this, as it significantly affects their lives (I myself work earlier in the morning to finish at 4pm to miss rush hour traffic in both directions, and so I have a little bit of daylight left at the end of the day - however I've been told that I would not be able to petition for flexible working hours with these reasons as they are not valid and would be rejected..and have also been told that I would be one of the worst affected by the change in rules). The move to the new building also offers no car parking space, so those that currently park on the company's property are effectively having to take a pay cut in order to pay for parking, or obtain an alternative means of getting to the office - usually at the additional expensive of significantly increased commute times.\n\n\nMy question is basically this - Can they legally do this? What are the options for employees if they disagree to the new rigid rules and will (or have) get a formal request for flexible working hours rejected because their reasons are not \"valid\" in the eyes of the business? If the company lets staff go as a result of not agreeing to these rigid terms, are there grounds for constructive/unfair dismissal?\n\n\nSorry I've rambled on a bit, but it's quite difficult to get a lot of this across.

But wait, there's more\nThis all happens in Minnesota. \n\n\nEmployee E worked for company A and had standard noncompete agreement. Agreement has an assignment clause assigning rights to any successor. Company B buys most business units of company A and hires most employees. Seller of A starts new company N. E stays with seller of A and works for new company N. Assume it's clear that language of noncompete contract assigned to B all rights of all of A's employees who now work for B. \n\n\nA was in the business of providing medical billing services to hospitals. E worked in that industry when hired by A. During employment E developed a product to detect fraud within hospitals and stopped working on billing and started working on the product. When B buys A, it only buys the billing business. Seller of A starts new business explicitly to sell fraud product and invites E to come along. There is an implied option for E to stay on and work for B, but B does not express interest in E and has no contact with E before the sale. Seller has an explicit new agreement with B (it is specific to seller the person) that seller will not engage in medical billing business. E has no new agreement. \n\n\nSeller commences new business N. E has no new agreement or paperwork with N. Not even a tax form. N is a small company and does not provide health insurance but since E received benefits under his spouse's employer there was no change in status in that regard. The only change is that auto deposit pay checks were now from N. \n\n\nHospital who previously worked with seller at company A contacts seller, asking for consulting work on a billing problem. Because of seller's agreement with B, the consulting contract is written between hospital and B, with N working under a separate agreement with B. Basically N does all the work while B prints invoices and sends 50% of money to N. \n\n\nSeller goes to hospital and brings E along for the consulting job. In the course of the work, hospital offers E a job. Not just a job, the job - the one that's being filled by the contract work. Counsel for hospital sees no problem with the offer as it relates to hospital's actions and let's assume that's a correct assessment. But what about E? \n\n\nIs there any legal doctrine whereby E's agreement with A continued to apply to E in his work for company N? What about B? Do they have any standing to block E's going to work for a B's customer? My thinking here is that E technically has a noncompete agreement with B but perhaps there is a generally accepted public policy theory whereby employers can't enforce agreements against former employees especially under these facts. \n\n\nReasonable minds may suggest that neither B nor N have an interest in blocking the employment. But let's assume seller is pissed bc now E won't be available to develop product for N and B is pissed because the hiring stops the gravy train and cuts off future potential work. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 3}

There's no HOA and since we get snow there's one neighbor who has done the job of asking everyone to chip in for snow plowing, and then another neighbor got a quote for repaving and most of the residents paid that too. It's an old road and no one on the street is interested in doing the work and expense of getting it town-maintained. On the county's parcel viewer the road itself is not owned by anyone.\n\n\nAbout a year ago a neighbor moved in that drives very fast on our small little street. He's almost hit me, and more importantly I have two little kids who I'm terrified are going to get hit by a car. I called my police officer friend (in this city) and he said there isn't much he can do. There's no speed limit since it's not a town road. We've talked to the neighbor several times and he always just says \"I drive fine, I slow down when I see the kids, I can stop fine.\" He's really a jerk, to be honest. My wife and I, and another neighbor with small kids, is genuinely scared of him hurting out kids.\n\n\nI went out and bought some speed bumps, like actual industrial versions that can be bolted to the ground. They're yellow and black with little reflectors in them, the kind a condo complex would install. They're removable so I can pull them in the winter for snow plows to operate.\n\n\nA friend of mine said that by installing them I'm introducing liability on myself because if anyone has an accident right there they can blame the speed bumps. I'm trying to figure out if I have legitimate legal exposure, and what I can do to mitigate it. I'm planning on putting them (two of them, about ~5 apart) in front of my property on the road so I can put signs up. I can write letters and hand deliver them to every neighbor. I can put a public notice in the local paper yearly.

{"text": "How to negotiate a payment for copyright infringement?\nI am looking for some advice on copyright infringement.\nWe are an independent media run by volunteers and have not income, assets or offices at all. Therefore the staff varies. One of the volunteer download a photo from a blog that it seemed to be free use (the photo has been published hundreds of times in blogs that doesn\u2019t ask for copyright) and we published the photo thinking it was OK. \n\n\nBut weeks ago a company called Copytrack emailed us and asked for money for the copyright infringement. So, I do some research, and found that indeed the use of the photo needed a license but when it was downloaded by the volunteer it was from a blog. So, it was a real mistake, but also an unintentional copyright infringement. So I remove the pic and article in full and I sent an email apologising for the mistake and even I offer to do an interview to the photographer or something similar, as we don\u2019t have money.\n\n\nThey replied in identical terms they told @user1889580 \u201cyou have infringed on our client's image, pay us right away to avoid legal issues\u201d, etc.\n\n\nSo, I reply with a more comprehensive letter, apologising again, explaining that we don\u2019t\u2019 receive money, plus we never make any profit from the work we published. Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. \n\n\nThey haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. \n\n\nThe amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. \n\n\nI am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. \n\n\nI have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it. But like @user1889580 , I am worried. I am ready to pay, but to be honest the blog doesn\u2019t have money and me either, so I I have asked for a symbolic fee or for the minimum amount. \n\n\nI am still checking and doing some research but I would appreciate your advice.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": -1}

A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities. Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit/debit card.\n\n\nI'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned. I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.\n\n\nA few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:\n\n\nI assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.\n\n\nLikewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.\n\n\nHowever, what about a more ambiguous case. If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 4}

{"text": "Would police in the US have any alternative for handling a confiscated computer with a hidden partition?\nI've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 4}

Bilateral means both parties are bound on the exchange of promises,\n>  although there has yet to be any performance of those promises.  \n> \n>  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A typical sale of goods agreement is bilateral. \n> \n> \n> ### Practical example 1\n> \n> \n> Alex offers (or promises) to sell his bicycle to Becky for \u00a3150 and Becky accepts, thereby promising\n>  to pay \u00a3150. (We will use this as our example of a bilateral agreement and look at variations and additions\n>  to the facts throughout this chapter.)\n> \n> \n> Definition\n> ----------\n> \n> \n> **Unilateral agreements:** consist of a promise in exchange for an act. It follows that only one party is\n>  bound at the outset by a promise. The other\u2019s acceptance is the performance of the requested act.  \n> \n>  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For example, a typical unilateral agreement will involve an offer of a reward and may be\n>  phrased as an \u2018if\u2019 contract: I promise to pay \u00a350 to anyone who finds and returns my lost dog.\n> \n> \n> ### Practical example 2\n> \n> \n> Daniel offers (or promises) a free watch to anyone who returns three tokens from the packets of\n>  cereal he manufactures, together with a cheque for \u00a35. Emily accepts by returning the three tokens\n>  with her cheque for \u00a35. (We will use this as our example of a unilateral agreement and return to this\n>  example later in the chapter.)\n> \n> \n> \n\n\np 6.\n\n\n\n> \n> Making the correct distinction.\n> -------------------------------\n> \n> \n> It is not possible to accept a unilateral offer by promising to\n>  find and return the lost dog or by promising to collect and return the tokens and the cheque. By\n>  comparison, the agreement to sell the bicycle cannot be unilateral. Students sometimes suggest\n>  that a simple sale contract is unilateral by interpreting the act of paying for the bicycle as the\n>  requested act. This is incorrect since, as long as it is possible to accept by promising to buy (which\n>  it is in the example), the agreement will be bilateral.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

It would be different if, for example, you used bunch of existing or valid hashes to compose them in ASCII art - but it would protect that piece of ASCII art only, wouldnt it?\nPlus, from my point of view - they are factual things. `Windows.dll` version `1.0.2.003` has md5hash `aea603dba12c6e23b7b0ab9db4f81120` - this is a fact.

{"text": "Consumer Rights Act 2015 vs EU DIRECTIVE 93/13/EEC\nI am interested in the interplay of the EU directive [93/13/EEC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31993L0013) and the Consumer Rights Act 2015 in the UK.\n\n\nSpecifically the Consumer Rights Act has an exclusion from assessment of fairness where the clause specifies the main subject matter of the contract. But this is not mentioned in the directive so seems to severely limit the applicability of the directive.\n\n\nI am interested because we have a mortgage that changed from a fixed rate to a tracker but the tracker has a floor preventing the rate from falling below a certain level. The floor is clearly outlined in the contract for the mortgage, however, we were unaware of it when we signed and actually assumed we have been repaying at a lesser rate than what we were.\n\n\nI would like to argue that the floor introduced a significant unfair imbalance as it protected the lender from a reduction in the base rate without providing us with protection from raising rates.\n\n\nIt seems many Spanish mortgages with similar \"floor\" contracts have had the floor nullified for similar reasons and they seem to be referring to the EU directive.\n\n\nI have also come across a EU Court of Justice [ruling](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62011CJ0415&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre=) regarding the directive which states:\n\n\n\n> \n> the concept of \u2018significant imbalance\u2019 to the detriment of the consumer must be assessed in the light of an analysis of the rules of national law applicable in the absence of any agreement between the parties, in order to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the contract places the consumer in a less favourable legal situation than that provided for by the national law in force. To that end, an assessment of the legal situation of that consumer having regard to the means at his disposal, under national law, to prevent continued use of unfair terms, should also be carried out;\n> \n> \n> in order to assess whether the imbalance arises \u2018contrary to the requirement of good faith\u2019, it must be determined whether the seller or supplier, dealing fairly and equitably with the consumer, could reasonably assume that the consumer would have agreed to the term concerned in individual contract negotiations.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThat seems to suggest that a court would need to consider if I would have accepted the terms if I had been able to negotiate them with assistance of professional advice which would have been unlikely due to the one sided nature of the clause.\n\n\nUK law would seem to make the floor legally valid regardless of fairness because the floor was a \"main part\" of the agreement which means it is excluded from the fairness test.\n\n\nI am a bit out of my depth and definitely do not understand how an EU directive / ruling could affect my argument. However, is it the case that the EU directive / EU Court ruling can override the UK law?\n\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice as to how best to formulate my argument with my lender or if I really don't have a leg to stand on from a legal perspective.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

Did you see any privacy policies? Did you accept anything? No, you don't know how that data will be used. Of course it could be sent to a stupid random website, that will never use it for anything. Or it could be sent to a big corporation, or to a content delivery network, or any website that is big enough to be able to track you with this data, because they have a lot of services (or just hotlinked images) around spread all over the web. Note: the data is actually sent to Imgur, which I believe would definitely be able to track you, given the huge amount of pictures on the internet that link to them.\n\n\nI've always seen people mainly worried about third-party assets (Google Analytics or Facebook buttons, etc.), some also began to worry about Google Fonts (that's a third-party asset too actually), but I don't think anybody ever brought up the issue of hotlinked images. That's third-party stuff. And communities like this one are basically allowing users to embed third party assets.\n\n\n**Who's responsible for this?** Is it the user's fault, because they should always make sure the image source complies with the GDPR? I doubt it. The website owner's fault (Stackexchange), because they should not allow hotlinking? I'd say yeah, probably. Or the third-party website's fault, for not complying with the GDPR? I'd say no, for all we know they could be based in a country that doesn't even know what the GDPR is.\n\n\nSo my conclusion is that hotlinking should be treated like loading a third-party asset, and if the website owner cannot check the privacy policies of every hotlinked image (for example because it would be impossible in a community like this one), then unsupervised hotlinking should be disabled because the GDPR does not allow it.

This question does address the technical side of uploading only a partial address book, but it mainly focuses on the legal perspective. So perhaps it is on-topic here.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nA year ago I gave into the nagging and started to use WhatsApp. With the recent update I have agree to new terms of use which contain this (italic emphasis mine):\n\n\n\n> \n> **Address Book.** You provide us the phone numbers of WhatsApp users and your other contacts in your mobile phone address book on a regular basis. You confirm *you are authorized to provide us such numbers* to allow us to provide our Services.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSo in principle I would have to send a message to each and every one of my contacts in order to ask. And while I am at it, I would actually also ask for Telegram, Hangouts, Wire, Skype, Duo, Signal; perhaps just a general authorization would be the easiest.\n\n\nThen I get back a bunch of messages which I archive somewhere securely in care somebody sues me about it. Then I can prove that they gave me permission to upload their contact details. This is just tedious and a lot of work, but technically it can be done.\n\n\nWhat do I do about the people who do not agree? Android 6.0 on my phone does not seem to allow to give only selected contacts to WhatsApp. This means that I would have to delete the number on my phone which sounds utterly inconvenient. My contacts are stored in my Google account. Should I have asked my contacts for that already?\n\n\nIs there anything I can actually do about this? I think my options are the following:\n\n\n1. Continue to use WhatsApp (like virtually everyone else) and ignore that I could potentially be sued by somebody who would not consent to his contact information being uploaded.\n\n\nAs I am a German citizen living in Germany, I am not sure where I would be sued, actually. WhatsApp has no department in Germany, so the US law covers my relationship with WhatsApp. Can another German citizen sue with under US law in Germany? Can only US citizens sue me, would I have to fly to the US? All in all it seems like a non-issue in personal life.\n2. Delete the WhatsApp account (if possible) and not use the service any more. In principle I would have to get rid of all the other messaging apps as well. I couldn't store my contact list in my Google account then either, right? That is also sharing the data with other people.\n3. Attempt to ask every one of my 532 contacts whether it is okay to upload their phone number. Otherwise delete the phone number or the whole contact from my address book. Keep track of these numbers in a paper notebook at home (in a safe).\n\n\nMy actual question: Is the third option actually possible?

What I'd really hope to avoid is actually having to collect things like their Social Security Numbers, EIN's, etc, let alone any of the other compliance type issues that could arise.\n\n\nI'm wondering a couple of things.\n\n\nFirst: The need to issue 1099's doesn't actually arise until you're paying out $600 or more in a given year. Could I feasibly just let the program run, but only make the requirement of providing an SSN for tax purposes kick in when the affiliate is going to go over the limit? Ie, for the first $550, no SSN checks required, but after that, they need to provide this info to receive additional payments?\n\n\nSecond: If I only make payments through a service like PayPal, who I presume has crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's, does this alleviate my need to do any additional checks on people (not that I even know what checks would be made).\n\n\nThird: Going hand in hand with the only making payments through PayPal idea - If i accurately record payments to affiliates as Services provided, does PayPal take care of 1099's as part of their role? In that I would only have to report payments made to PayPal, and it would be on them to report payments made to the ultimate beneficiary?\n\n\nThis isn't a business that's been launched, but I'm trying to think out issues beforehand, and this is the biggest one I can think of - I would personally rather not have myself or anyone one on my team even be able to access anyone's SSN's, but if it moved forward, I would obviously want to do so in a way that was compliant with the IRS and any other regs.\n\n\nAny thoughts or guidance would be appreciated, unless it's \"contact an Accountant\" - I already know that's the most correct answer, I'm simply wondering if anyone else has gone down this road and can save me a little time and money on this, as this is still just idea phase, not operating business phase.\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

Nevermind that \"Public\" was simply their software's default save location, and they again knew nothing of the ramifications. Thus, this poor student gets slammed, completely out-of-the-blue, for something they had no idea about.\n* The developer/owner of that music-management software may also get sued for making it easy for this to happen. (Public by default)\n* The dorm's IT department might get a not-so-nice call as well, from a high-powered lawyer, about making it easy for this to happen. (requiring access)\n* ***\\*I\\**** could simply claim ignorance, that the officially-enforced arrangement implied permission, and that I had accepted the offer on good faith. I would then get off with little more than an order to delete everything that I had taken.

They're both working hand in hand against the interests of the employees/dues-paying union members.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nImagine a Corporation (C) that's affiliated with a union (U). They agree on a contract that says extra work should go to more senior people. If the company needs to call people to work an extra shift, it is supposed to call the most senior people first.\n\n\nHowever, the company blatantly ignores the contract, recruiting the LEAST senior people.\n\n\nWhen an employee with seniority with high seniority files a grievance, C and U both lie, intimidate and stonewall. For example, the union claims the company won't give them its payroll records, making it impossible for them to know who worked when. And when the company finally hands the records over - three months later - the union won't let the grievance see the records.\n\n\nThe union also makes grievance jump through all kinds of hoops. If you file a grievance, you're expected to do all the detective work - cite a particular less senior worker, with details (time, date, location) and have it signed by a witness. The irony is that there could be a dozen less senior people who worked that day, a fact the payroll records could easily prove.\n\n\nBut the union refuses to go on a \"fishing expedition.\"\n\n\nLong story short, grievances are typically solved six to nine months after they're filed, and the grievants never expect to get more than about 30% of what they're owed.\n\n\nThe state Dept. of Labor says \"contact the National Labor Board.\" The National Labor Board says a contract - and its interpretation - is between C and U; they can do whatever they want.\n\n\nIs that really the end of the road, or is there some kind of legal or quasi-legal action one could take? If you know the company and union are both withholding information, lying, delaying payouts, etc., can you cite them for violating any particular laws? What about a union that \"interprets\" and enforces the contract two different ways, giving its cronies all their support while thumbing their nose at everyone else?\n\n\nIt appears that the only recourse would be legal action, but it's hard to determine whether any laws have been violated.

If money has been paid directly to the other party then of course it will be returned\n>  as part of the remedy of rescission itself; the indemnity is instead concerned with payments\n>  made under the contract to third parties. In *Whittington v Seale-Hayne* (1900) the indemnity\n>  included money paid out in rates and to do repairs which the tenant was obliged to do under\n>  the lease and which benefited the landlord directly, but it did not extend to medical expenses\n>  and loss of stock which, although foreseeable, were not incurred under an obligation contained\n>  in the lease. (These latter, and other items claimed, would only be recoverable if a right\n>  to damages could have been established, which at the time would have meant proving\n>  fraud\u2014the increased availability of damages today would mean that the limited right to an\n>  indemnity is less commonly relevant.)\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nPaul Davies.

Note clearly that I am not saying that the quoted statement is the best legal way of putting this, it's purely an example.\n\n\nNow, lets say that a user uses this service for a year whilst an adblocker is running. Lets also say that the user has signed up for the service and explicitly consented the Terms of Service. Is there any way that the service could lawfully get this user to pay up for his usage of the service (the loss of income)? Or if not, is there *any* form of 'punishment' the user could face? (Beyond being blocked from the service, but he could also be blocked from the service even if he didn't use an adblocker if the service answer would feel like it) And if yes, does it require such an explicit segment in the ToS or is this already a natural given?\n\n\nPS. I have selected the [united-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") as the main focus of the question, simply because it's most likely to get a quality answer, however if you also know how the same would work out in a western european country I would love it if an answer could include a *very* short rundown of that as well. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 13}

STC sought to counter the arbitrators' finding that on 23rd December the sellers had brought the contract to an end (in the popular sense) by submitting that STC's silence or continuing unwillingness to open the letter of credit between 19th and 23rd December might in itself be regarded as an acceptance of the sellers' assumed breach of condition. In my view this is not a tenable proposition. What is commonly referred to as an acceptance of a repudiation must be communicated to the party in breach or at least overtly evinced: see e.g. Chitty on Contracts, 25th ed. vol. 1 para. 1598, *[Heyman v. Darwins (1942) AC 356 at p. 361](https://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&linktype=ref&context=13&crumb-action=replace&docguid=IBFF78C61E42711DA8FC2A0F0355337E9)* and The Mihalis Angelos (1971) 1 QB 164 explicitly at p. 204 E per Megaw LJ. The decision of the High Court of Australia in Holland v. Wiltshire (1954) 90 CLR 409 shows that an unequivocal overt act which is inconsistent with the subsistence of the contract may be sufficient, without any concurrent manifestation of intent directed to the other party. But saying and doing nothing at all, other than a continuing failure to perform, cannot constitute an acceptance of a repudiation even if the grounds for such an acceptance then exist. **Such conduct would be equivocal and equally consistent with a decision not to exercise the right to treat the contract as repudiated**.\n> \n> \n> It follows that I cannot accept that STC's silence and inactivity between 18th and 23rd December can be regarded as having had any legal consequences. No doubt they were reluctant, if not unwilling, to pay a large sum in U.S. dollars against documents for a cargo lying at the bottom of the sea, perhaps in particular since it was insured in India and therefore not necessarily in some external currency.

Before each overnight trip, I request (and am granted) a travel permit from my NJ probation officer.\n* 4 months after my conviction and subsequent transfer to NJ, my former *NYC* Probation Officer contacted me, stating that the initial DNA sample that she'd taken was unable to be processed by their lab, and that I should come in (to NYC) ASAP to submit a new sample. She also sent a letter to my NJ Probation Officer, making the same request.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Question** (detailed version):\n\n\n**Am I obligated to return to NY for another DNA collection? Does NY have any jurisdiction over me now that I've been transferred to NJ?**\n\n\nI acknowledge that I was required to submit the sample initially, which I did. Did my obligation end there, or am I required to resubmit until NY State is satisfied (bearing in mind that I neither reside in or am supervised by NY State)?\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nUpdate in response to questions: Let me state that (1) I've already discussed this with my NJ PO (she asked me to go to NY and submit a new sample, though I'm not sure whether she really cares whether I do), and (2) I'm looking for legal facts about my situation (e.g. what I'm legally *required or not required* to do), not advice on what I *should* do.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 3}

The only thing I can find that relates to my question is information about the strategies of lawyers who defended notorious murderers who were overwhelmingly guilty. I would like the scope of my question to be something less serious and less complicated than that. In most of those cases, the defenses' main goal was to keep them out of a death penalty, and the trials were long and complicated. Also, to be thorough, please feel free to note / comment on any of the following in an answer:\n\n\n* You know there is practically no conceivable defense for your client; how does that change your efforts in plea bargaining?\n* Let's say the prosecutor won't budge - not a single plea offer. You know there is practically no conceivable defense for your client - what do you do when the case goes to trial?\n* At any point, is it a matter of ethics to make it clear to your client that there is no conceivable defense for their case and your primary service as their counsel will be to provide guidance through the confusing and complicated legal / court process and help make sure their rights to a fair trial are upheld?\n* Now suppose you are not necessarily a public defender but a private attorney for hire. Someone comes to you looking to hire you for counsel on the type of charges outlined above. There is little to no conceivable defense. Do you take the case?

A lot of the stuff you find is pretty vague so it can be extremely difficult to have a good understanding of what you can/can't do. There are a range of different styles things can be done in, so how would it be determined if something is \"too similar\" and therefore infringes copyright.\n\n\nThis came into thought while looking at \"Zelda - A link to the past\". The game itself is very basic in design, 2D low resolution textures etc. If this were to be remade in 3D which would look completely different to the original style, could it still be considered too close? Does this account for storyline too, can you copy that?\n\n\nI read this in another post:\n\n\n\n> \n> Copyright will protect only the computer program in the form written by a programmer i.e. its source code. Neither the functionality of a computer program, nor the programming language or the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression of that program, and thus, those are not protected by copyright\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSo is storyline considered functionality and therefore exempt? It's too vague and is quite intimidating, any information on this subject would be interesting.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I am not looking for advice but rather a broader understanding of such a vague concept. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

That's third-party stuff.

I'd say no, for all we know they could be based in a country that doesn't even know what the GDPR is.\n\n\nSo my conclusion is that hotlinking should be treated like loading a third-party asset, and if the website owner cannot check the privacy policies of every hotlinked image (for example because it would be impossible in a community like this one), then unsupervised hotlinking should be disabled because the GDPR does not allow it.

{"text": "Does showing an image as part of a presentation fall within the domain of copyright?\nI am interested on the following situation due to its importance in an academic setting (which makes question about it common on Academia SE):\n\n\nSuppose I legally obtain some digital image created by somebody else (e.g., by downloading from a public website). I then show this image as part of a presentation for my talk during an academic conference.

The talk is not recorded or broadcast; the presentation is not distributed.\n\n\nMy question is whether this situation falls in the domain of copyright, i.e.: **Is showing an image in such a fashion something that is an exclusive right of the copyright holder** (unless specified otherwise)**?** I am interested in the general international situation, e.g., the Berne Convention.

The contract of interest is with a gym, which might be relevant because contracts with them sometimes have special rules.\n\n\nIn Germany, a contract with companies may not extend a duration of 2 years ([BgB \u00a7309 9b](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__309.html)).

This was deemed to exceed the 2 year duration (2 years + one month without usage, but a signed contract), so the customer was able to terminate the contract earlier than expected.\n\n\nIn my case, I signed a contract on date X, the 2 years started on \"X + 2 weeks\". Then, at \"X + 2 weeks + 2 years\" the contract was automatically extended by one year. This extension was announced in the original contract.\n\n\nMy question is, whether the contract can still be canceled immediately. I can se an argument for both sides:\n\n\n* Yes, it can be canceled: The first contract period was invalid, it became an unlimited contract, cancelable at any time. Therefore, there was no need for an extension. It's still the same contract, so it can be canceled now.\n* No, it cannot be canceled: While the contract could have been canceled during the first 2 years, the extension made this a new contract. Now, this contract is for 1 year only, so that's within the limits and is valid.\n\n\nWhich one applies in this situation?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 2}

For example, say there is a fee for an insurance that cost $5000. The normal fee for such insurance worth only $50.\n\n\nNo customers would agree to pay $5k for something worth $50. So instead of writing $5k fee, the insurance would write that certain percentage some terms are invented. Then the terms are written a bit differently on other pages.\n\n\nSo a customer that want to know there is a $5k fee will have to combine info from a few different pages with slightly different terms. Otherwise, the way it's written, it's kind of expected that most customers would fail to see the fee.\n\n\nAnd that's what the insurance company wants.\n\n\nOf course there is a term that says that you understand the whole contract bla bla that users tend to sign.\n\n\nA judge can see the contract and see that the very unreasonable fee is technically written.

{"text": "When does a digital document become subject to copyright?\nIn the USA, a document is subject to copyright when it is \"fixed in a tangible medium\". What counts as \"fixing in a tangible medium\" for a digital document? Is it enough to save a copy of the file to a local, private disk, or must said file be made available to another person (e.g. via publication on the internet)?\n\n\nTo make this concrete, let's suppose Alice has a version control repository (such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/)), which is initially private and is later made public. In the USA, at what point does the contents of the repository become subject to copyright? (Assuming that the contents are of a type of material eligible for copyright.)\n\n\nConsider the following hypothetical timeline:\n\n\n* 2010: Alice initializes a Git repository. It is initially empty and is stored only on Alice's local computer.\n* 2011: Alice creates and adds file A to the repository. (The repository is still private.)\n* 2012: Alice creates and adds file B to the repository. (Again private.)\n* 2013: Alice makes the repository publicly available.\n* 2014: Alice adds file C to the repository (which is now public, so the file is published immediately).\n\n\nNow, what is the correct copyright year to apply to each file in the repository? (Let's assume the files are not modified after they are added. Let's also suppose that the version control system metadata, including timestamps, is correct and hasn't been altered.)\n\n\nFor file C, the answer is fairly obvious: the file was created, added, and published in 2014, so the copyright date has to be 2014.\n\n\nFor A and B, the answer isn't so obvious. I used to think the answer was 2013, since that was the time at which the files were made publicly available. However, I recently talked to a laywer about the case of a physical document which is later published, and said laywer (though **not** providing legal advice) said the copyright date would be the time at which that physical document was created, rather than published (since at the time of creation, it is already fixed in a tangible medium, even if it hasn't yet been published). If that is true, the copyright dates for A and B would have to be 2011 and 2012, respectively, since that is when those files are authored and created.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

In the last few years, Nintendo has shut down hundreds of fan games of the Super Mario franchise and many others. Super Mario Bros X the fan game got shut down as well as Super Mario Bros Z the animated crossover Flash movie. The only game I know surviving so far is Mario Forever.\n\n\nHowever, there are companies that use their fans as resources to make good games for them for real money. The perfect example of that is Sega when they allowed fans to create their own hacks of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games as well as their own engines, original games and even games that are original offsprings such as Freedom Planet and Spark the Electric Jester. Sega allowed the hosting of many game jams and hackathons for game developers to learn how to make games by remixing the original Sonic games and trying to make something awesome out of them. There have been fan game collections such as Sonic Megamix and very popular Sonic fan games like Sonic Robo Blast. Sega has never had any problems with fan games or any kind of fan work and they have always allowed their fans to use their intellectual property for their own enjoyment.\n\n\nThe question now is, is there a list, an article, an analysis or a method of analysis such as Freedom to Operate, in order to find out which companies are okay with the remixing of their intellectual property. Another question is if there are any open source video games that allow fan work to be done and under which license types (copyleft (GPL), copycenter (MIT)). Has anyone ever tried to figure that out? Please let me know as well as many other people who are too poor to hire a lawyer to tell them what's legal so that they can peacefully make their own fan works.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": -1}

However, what I wonder about is if some of the above logic does not also, then, apply to a situation like this: if one were to, given this fact, *falsely* announce on such a forum that one had committed a crime that one actually did not, could it amount to having the same effect of wasting prosecutor/law enforcement time albeit in a more indirect way that sneaks through their attitudes, and thus potentially also be considered some kind of crime?\n\n\n(I want to point out I'm not referring to making a false claim to be the perpetrator of a known crime, or to falsely claim someone else is that perpetrator to, say, get reward money.

Counsel for hospital sees no problem with the offer as it relates to hospital's actions and let's assume that's a correct assessment. But what about E? \n\n\nIs there any legal doctrine whereby E's agreement with A continued to apply to E in his work for company N? What about B? Do they have any standing to block E's going to work for a B's customer? My thinking here is that E technically has a noncompete agreement with B but perhaps there is a generally accepted public policy theory whereby employers can't enforce agreements against former employees especially under these facts. \n\n\nReasonable minds may suggest that neither B nor N have an interest in blocking the employment. But let's assume seller is pissed bc now E won't be available to develop product for N and B is pissed because the hiring stops the gravy train and cuts off future potential work. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 3}

This is known because of statements he made to attorneys before trial. The judge also actively advocated on behalf of the plaintiff, was very biased as well. The net result was, I was removed as trustee. An accounting was ordered. The Judge retired. Jump ahead 18 months. A trial was set because of objections to my accounting. After 3 days of trial, the new judge over ruled all objections. It was determined that the attorney for the trust I had hired had given me poor advice, bordering on malpractise. My current trial attorney had, unfortunately, neglected to enter the exhibit that supported this conclusion as evidence. Even though the judge had the information, he said he was unable to use it as it was not entered as evidence. So I was surcharged these fees, which is a high 5 figure. This judge also stated that he was satisfied in all respects with my performance as trustee and expressed surprise that I was removed. Now, my current trial attorney , the one who neglected to admit the exhibit, wants to go after the original attorney for those fees on a contingency basis, his fee to be 50% of the recovered money.

About a year ago, my mother passed away, and the psychological trauma was extreme. I already suffer from clinical chronic depression, and this even took a toll on me.\n\n\nFor a six-month period, there were several instances where I missed work without notice. Admittedly, I could have communicated an out-of-office status, but my depression seemed to overwhelm me to a point where it was difficult to communicate. Upon a conversation with my manager, I communicated that I understood the need/requirement of communication, and I began seeking intense therapy (both alone and with group support) on Mondays. My employer made accommodations to this and allowed me to work only Tuesday-Thursday.\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was asked by my manager when Mondays were going to be available again, and I was told my team/colleagues were feeling a lack of cohesion with the team on my part. I told her I'm still working through this loss and therapy has been immensely helpful, but she pushed the cohesion issue again. I felt guilted/pressured into willfully terminating my Monday therapy.\n\n\nA month ago, I accidentally only requested 2 days of PTO (in our PTO system) for a trip to celebrate my mother's passing. I communicated effectively with the team that I would be gone for three days, and they even marked it appropriately in our team-level capacity sheet.\n\n\nI was confronted two weeks ago by my manager stating that I am not communicating well enough with my team, and that no one was aware of this extra day.

While I don't mind guided direction to regain team cohesion, these requests--especially the \"@here\" portion, felt extremely degrading, especially if I just had to use the restroom.

There's no HOA and since we get snow there's one neighbor who has done the job of asking everyone to chip in for snow plowing, and then another neighbor got a quote for repaving and most of the residents paid that too.

We've talked to the neighbor several times and he always just says \"I drive fine, I slow down when I see the kids, I can stop fine.\" He's really a jerk, to be honest. My wife and I, and another neighbor with small kids, is genuinely scared of him hurting out kids.\n\n\nI went out and bought some speed bumps, like actual industrial versions that can be bolted to the ground.

That was the \"contract\".\n\n\nGoing to the domestic violence course provider, the counselor evaluating me for domestic violence found that it was unwarranted, and sent that back to the judge (under whom I have my probation) - the domestic violence program is unwarranted.\n\n\nI later learned the judge then called the manager of the counselor and \"demanded that I do something\", and the manager overturned the counselor. I then returned to take domestic violence \"group\" from a the other main counselor there (per the judges requirements). I was not given another evaluation. \n\n\nThe other counselor was horrible and after 10 sessions totally threw me out and literally filed lies into the judge (covering his horrible actions toward me), saying I was kicked out. The judge then gave this letter to the prosecutor, but not to my defense attorney (the same public defender re-assigned to me that I did the plea with).\n\n\nThis letter together with what the counselor's manager sent in, so inflamed the prosecutor against me, that the prosecutor demanded 180 days in jail, totally ignoring/forgoing my original contract of either 8 days in jail or domestic violence courses, which my new private attorney says is fully incorrect, also the judge should have stuck to my evaluation result (that was part of the contract too). So with the contract broken twice and now someone coming in fully lying, and me trying to correct multiple times with other court staff, I chose to flee my home and state (Arizona), later to return and be arrested, and post bail. The court/prosecutor continues to come after me even though I did 18 days in jail, \"unendingly abusive.\" \n\n\nA civil attorney just told me that in civil cases, any information a judge receives, the judge must give to both sides/parties. My new defense attorney agrees, but it's vague as to whether the judge has done non-correct-law practicing behavior, in not giving the letter to my public defender. \n\n\nMust a criminal judge take a provider's information and give it to both the prosecutor and the defense?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

Here is a list of some of them:\n\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre-copyright era, like 1000+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post-copyright-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright-free artifact (since it was created pre-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 6}

What I'd really hope to avoid is actually having to collect things like their Social Security Numbers, EIN's, etc, let alone any of the other compliance type issues that could arise.\n\n\nI'm wondering a couple of things.\n\n\nFirst: The need to issue 1099's doesn't actually arise until you're paying out $600 or more in a given year. Could I feasibly just let the program run, but only make the requirement of providing an SSN for tax purposes kick in when the affiliate is going to go over the limit? Ie, for the first $550, no SSN checks required, but after that, they need to provide this info to receive additional payments?\n\n\nSecond: If I only make payments through a service like PayPal, who I presume has crossed all the T's and dotted all the I's, does this alleviate my need to do any additional checks on people (not that I even know what checks would be made).\n\n\nThird: Going hand in hand with the only making payments through PayPal idea - If i accurately record payments to affiliates as Services provided, does PayPal take care of 1099's as part of their role? In that I would only have to report payments made to PayPal, and it would be on them to report payments made to the ultimate beneficiary?\n\n\nThis isn't a business that's been launched, but I'm trying to think out issues beforehand, and this is the biggest one I can think of - I would personally rather not have myself or anyone one on my team even be able to access anyone's SSN's, but if it moved forward, I would obviously want to do so in a way that was compliant with the IRS and any other regs.\n\n\nAny thoughts or guidance would be appreciated, unless it's \"contact an Accountant\" - I already know that's the most correct answer, I'm simply wondering if anyone else has gone down this road and can save me a little time and money on this, as this is still just idea phase, not operating business phase.\n\n\nMany thanks!\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

He was withdrawn from the role and his employer provided the client with a new person instead.\n\n\nAt that time he was given written notice by his employer that he was now \"in a Consultation process\" and if he could not find a new assignment within some period of time (as far as I know, no set time frame was given in writing, but verbally he understood that he had about 6 weeks) then his employment would be terminated \"on the grounds of skills mismatch with the current role.\"\n\n\nThey also verbally used the word \"redundancy\" but have subsequently retracted this and stated in writing that the role (with the specific client that he was withdrawn from) is not redundant, the work is ongoing and another person whose skills are better matched has filled that role.\n\n\nHe then continued looking for alternative assignments and spent time doing various training courses to broaden his skillset. Unfortunately he was not able to find another assignment that matched his skills within the time frame, and his employer has now given him notice.\n\n\nTo my mind (and from <https://www.gov.uk/dismissal/reasons-you-can-be-dismissed> ) there are two ways they could have done this:  \n\n- redundancy (not redundancy from the specific assignment he was withdrawn from, but redundancy from his outsourcing role in general if they no longer have any roles that need his skillset) - which would entail a redundancy payment  \n\n- dismissal due to \"Not being able to do your job properly\" - in which case he should have been through a disciplinary process etc., which he has not. \n\n\nI also work for a (different) consultancy firm and in my company we would definitely class this as redundancy and would pay a redundancy payment. The issue would be ours in that we would not have any suitable work for someone with his skillset, not that he was unable to perform the specific role we had originally allocated him to. \n\n\nIs my understanding correct? Assuming that he would be happy with an outcome of either a) having his job back and waiting until a role that matches his skillset comes along, or b) being paid a redundancy payment, what should be his next steps?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

{"text": "Price quoted vs Purchase Order\nSomewhat \"hypothetical\" question:\n\n\nI priced something for a customer, a total of 500 pcs, each **individually** listed, on an **invoice** for $100.00 each, for a total of $50k.\n\n\nThis customer then sends me a purchase order, which I sign for a price of $50K. This purchase order shows the total amount of the order, but not he amount of pieces.\n\n\nSince then, he has placed 5 orders of 50 pieces each (250 pcs total).\n\n\nNow, he never sent payment or **placed** an order for those 500 pcs. He's called everytime, given me payment for 50 pcs and placed the order for 50 pcs.\n\n\nObviously, **the price is different for 50 pcs**, because it takes longer to make 50 pcs then 100 pcs (time per pc) and material prices have increased (we are now 10 months after his original order / purchase order). So for every piece in these orders, he has paid $55.00 per pc.\n\n\nIts one thing if I quote a service for something and I myself delay manufacturing or installation, so then I have to deal with the increase in costs, but we never got paid for the original scope, so we never purchased that material, for example.\n\n\nHe now calls me saying that we have overcharged him in every order. I've explained to him that he ordered in small batches, not a bundle as quoted (actually invoiced) and that the material cost has increased. He believes that because I signed the Purchase Order we are bind to sell him these items for those prices.\n\n\n**My questions are:**\n\n\n1 - Do we have to sell for those prices? The Purchase order was for 500 pcs, so was the original invoice (which he never paid, instead placed small orders). Since he sent a PO for 500 pcs, that means technically he should have placed an order for 500 pcs correct? So these small orders technically do not match his original PO, and could be considered different orders, correct? (if he wants to get technical).\n\n\n3 - I am myself not overly worried about this, I can take the easy way out with less headache and just make the remainder of the pieces for less money to have the final price be the same $50k. I'm not gonna lose that much in what the cost of the material is for me, but it is gonna cost me more in labor and reduce the profit on the material. I can see how I should've protected myself better, by perhaps not pricing by item, by writing \"priced as a bundle\", but ultimately, who is right and who is wrong?\n\n\nJust to give an example, these are custom made items. Things that don't lose value as new, lets say like a metal chair. You can purchase the same chair today for $50, but next year, the same model, made later on, costs $60 because of the increase in costs.\n\n\nIf it also makes a difference, this took place in MA.\n\n\nIf I can clarify things better, let me know and I'll edit the question.\n\n\nPlease don't be harsh, I'm not a lawyer, I'm trying to learn to be able to back myself up better in the future.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

There is no central EU authority at the moment which supplies \"official\" information on EU level and Taxamo and others don't have a crystal ball that the EC doesn't have\n2. the technical aspects of the integration enable you to get the transaction counts \"99.9% right\"\n3. simply knowing a [tax rate](https://vatinfo.eu/) doesn't really help you apply the tax rate all the time - in Croatia for example you need to pay the tax when you issue the invoice, not when funds get billed to your account, for example\n4. you are liable, not the service provider, if something is calculated badly\n5. in some EU countries like Croatia your business will get a huge fine if it's just 2-3 euros off\n\n\n***So... Here's the little chain question*** :)\n\n\n1. is there any way to comply with these rules 100%?\n2. if not, how much bad stuff can happen if you don't comply with the regulation 100%? But 99.9% for example :D (simply because of technical limitations some transactions will not be presented or calculated properly) Does the bad stuff depend on your country, the country of the buyer or combination of both?\n3. if the bad stuff is bad, and if there's no way of complying technically are there ways for a subscription based service selling an online service (using recurring credit card charges) to avoid being subject to this VAT scheme? (i.e. presenting the product in a different way or restricting yourself just to B2B transactions)\n4. if there's no way to avoid the VAT scheme does it make sense to open a company outside of the EU to handle payments if the said country does not acknowledge jurisdiction of EU law over its businesses, and\n5. if so, where? :) Or in short :D What would Google do? :D\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 3}

Are they safe to use a phrase that, if used unchallenged by others, might dilute the protection offered to their trademark?\n\n\n***Note**: I'm not asking whether this specific phrase would undermine the UHU trademark (if used by others); nor whether UHU's previous use of this phrase**2** might have undermined their own trademark. Answers targeting UK/English law preferred.*\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Background**\n\n\nIf a company has a Trademark (\u2122) or a Registered trademark (\u00ae)**3**, they have to take steps to protect it, or risk losing the protection that such marks offer. As well as guarding against direct infringements (a competitor using the protected mark on their own products), the other common area a company needs to defend against is letting the term pass into \"common usage\". As the article [**How to Protect Your Trademark From Infringement**](https://www.inc.com/guides/201101/how-to-protect-your-trademark-from-infringement.html) from the *inc.com* website says:\n\n\n\n> \n> Many aspiring entrepreneurs dream of turning their brand into a household word. But watch what you wish for\u2014if your trademark becomes the generic word for a kind of product, you could lose your ownership of it.\n> \n> \n> That was the fate of words like \"escalator\" (originally a trademark of Otis Elevator Co.), \"zipper\" (B.F. Goodrich), \"aspirin,\" and even \"heroin\" (both Bayer AG). Today companies like Kleenex and Xerox struggle to avoid such a fate through marketing campaigns aimed at reminding the public that they are a brand, not a product category.\n> \n> \n> \"The company most notorious for making sure you don't genericize their mark is Xerox, which insists that people use a Xerox copy machine, they don't 'make a Xerox,'\" says Albert**4**.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe Wikipedia page [**List of generic and genericized trademarks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generic_and_genericized_trademarks) includes lists of **(a)** former trademarks that have been genericized (where courts in at least some jurisdictions have ruled that the terms have become generic by becoming the common name of the relevant product or service); **(b)** former trademarks that have become generic for other reasons: typically through abandonment, non-renewal, or improper issuance (the generic term predated registration); and **(c)** protected trademarks frequently used as generic terms (e.g. Band-Aid\u00ae, Google\u00ae, Hoover\u00ae or Jacuzzi\u00ae) although still protected in some countries. ***Note**: Many of the marks in those lists are still protected in some countries, even if declared generic in others.*\n\n\nFrom the above, it is clear that a company that wants to preserve the protections afforded to their trademark must defend against uses such as \"*I'll hoover the carpet*\" or \"*I'll just google that*\". \"*Don't say glue, say UHU*\" would seem (to me) to fall into the same category.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**1** \u00ae2019 Bolton Adhesives, part of the Bolton Group.\n\n\n**2** I've not seen any adverts for UHU for many years, so I do not know whether they still use the phrase.

D\u2019s promise could not be specifically enforced against **D [1.]** since **[2.] D would not be\n>  able to get specific performance of C\u2019s obligation to renovate (it being a personal obligation)**.\n>  Furthermore, following Fry, the objection of lack of mutuality would still persist even\n>  if C had already done the renovation because the mutuality had to exist at the time of\n>  formation of the contract.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n1. This is a typo right? This ought be C.\n2. I don't understand the emboldened phrase.

The trial judge held\n>  that specific performance of an agreement to grant an underlease of a flat could not be ordered\n>  against the defendant because specific performance could not have been ordered against the\n>  claimant who had contracted to repair and decorate the flat (following Fry\u2019s approach). The\n>  Court of Appeal reversed this decision and granted specific performance of the underlease\n>  since the claimant had done the repairs and decoration until he had been prevented from doing\n>  so by the defendant, and he had promised to pay to the defendant the cost of completing the\n>  repairs he had not done. There was therefore no danger of the defendant being left high and\n>  dry after complying with the court\u2019s order of specific performance.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

However, any simple contract may potentially have ambiguities that would make it difficult or impossible to decide if the contract is being fulfilled. For example, if I make a contract for someone to fix my car, I should actually specify what exactly needs fixing and what would constitute being fixed. Otherwise the person could just top off the oil and call it a day.\n\n\nPresumably at some point, common sense is exercised to decide if some unexpected development follows this spirit and intent of the contract or not. After all, it's difficult if not impossible to state anything with perfect disambiguity. But [some contract authors still try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement#Criticism). Since EULAs are probably written by some pretty good lawyers, does that mean that such overly detailed documents can be considered the standard of a very good contract? What *is* a reasonable standard for how much a contract should specify, and how much should be left to \"well, let's just hope we can all come to some agreement if and when that weird freak case happens\".\n\n\nWhen contract lawyers write a contract, how do they decide when it's \"detailed enough\"?

But this is not mentioned in the directive so seems to severely limit the applicability of the directive.\n\n\nI am interested because we have a mortgage that changed from a fixed rate to a tracker but the tracker has a floor preventing the rate from falling below a certain level. The floor is clearly outlined in the contract for the mortgage, however, we were unaware of it when we signed and actually assumed we have been repaying at a lesser rate than what we were.\n\n\nI would like to argue that the floor introduced a significant unfair imbalance as it protected the lender from a reduction in the base rate without providing us with protection from raising rates.\n\n\nIt seems many Spanish mortgages with similar \"floor\" contracts have had the floor nullified for similar reasons and they seem to be referring to the EU directive.\n\n\nI have also come across a EU Court of Justice [ruling](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/celex.jsf?celex=62011CJ0415&lang1=en&type=TXT&ancre=) regarding the directive which states:\n\n\n\n> \n> the concept of \u2018significant imbalance\u2019 to the detriment of the consumer must be assessed in the light of an analysis of the rules of national law applicable in the absence of any agreement between the parties, in order to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the contract places the consumer in a less favourable legal situation than that provided for by the national law in force. To that end, an assessment of the legal situation of that consumer having regard to the means at his disposal, under national law, to prevent continued use of unfair terms, should also be carried out;\n> \n> \n> in order to assess whether the imbalance arises \u2018contrary to the requirement of good faith\u2019, it must be determined whether the seller or supplier, dealing fairly and equitably with the consumer, could reasonably assume that the consumer would have agreed to the term concerned in individual contract negotiations.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThat seems to suggest that a court would need to consider if I would have accepted the terms if I had been able to negotiate them with assistance of professional advice which would have been unlikely due to the one sided nature of the clause.\n\n\nUK law would seem to make the floor legally valid regardless of fairness because the floor was a \"main part\" of the agreement which means it is excluded from the fairness test.\n\n\nI am a bit out of my depth and definitely do not understand how an EU directive / ruling could affect my argument. However, is it the case that the EU directive / EU Court ruling can override the UK law?\n\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice as to how best to formulate my argument with my lender or if I really don't have a leg to stand on from a legal perspective.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 1}

{"text": "Does a non-disparagement clause in a settlement cover the oppositions attorney?\nA few years ago I started to have some disagreements with another party. At the time I had transacted less than $5000 in business. They involved a lawyer, and things got really ugly, really quickly. They sued, and then we settled out of court, but it cost me over $20K in legal bills. Most of this was time wasted in negotiation of a very simple settlement - I feel like the other attorney was intentionally prolonging the process. I have no idea how much it cost the other side. Looking back, I feel strongly that this lawyer intentionally stirred the pot, perhaps even misrepresenting me to them or them to me. I've also heard of another case were this same attorney intentionally made misrepresentations in order to create an ugly legal situation almost out of thin air. Now I'd like to say something to somebody - or just post something online saying \"this guy is a horse's ass.\" However, I have a non-disparagement clause in the settlement which seems like a standard one, saying that I can't disparage the business, including \"officers, directors, agents, attorneys,\" etc. On the one hand, this guy was their attorney at one point in time, so from the wording it would appear that this would cover him. However, he has no public affiliation to the business and my calling him out online wouldn't cast their business in any sort of negative light, and of course he gave me no considerations in the contract. I would think that the other side would never pursue this sort a breach, except for the fact that there is a liquidated damages clause - so in theory, this attorney, who likes to stir things up, could tell them - \"hey this guy disparaged your attorney - you win liquidated damages.\" \n\n\nIs there any sort of clear answer here? Assume for the point of argument that I'm smart enough to disparage him in a way that will never by linked to his former clients. \n\n\nEdit : More specifically, I would like to disparage their attorney for things he has done that are not related to my case. In particular, this guy has been sanctioned by the court for this kind of thing in another case. (Not my case, not pointing back toward me or my adversary.) The point would be to protect other businesses who might be misled into thinking that his services will provide an efficient resolution to similar situations. I should also point out that the Company has their own in-house attorney which would clearly be off-limits for me. \n\n\nThere's part of the settlement that says I can't publish information about the settlement \"for any reason\" so I hesitate to give the text of it (for all I know there could be some unique quirk that may allow them to find me if I do ) - but it appears to be pretty standard - I've seen similar agreements online. Someone asked for the clause so here's one from a different contract that is more-or-less the same. \n\n\n(Both parties) agree that they will not .... directly or indirectly, in any capacity or manner, publicly, by press release or similar public statement to the press, ... make, express, transmit speak, write, verbalize or otherwise communicate in any way (or cause, further, assist, solicit, encourage, support or participate in any of the foregoing), any remark, comment, message, information, declaration, communication or other statement of any kind, whether verbal, in writing, electronically transferred or otherwise, that might reasonably be construed to be derogatory or critical of, or negative toward, Citizen A, Company B or any of its directors, officers, Affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, attorneys or representatives (collectively, the \u201cCompany B Representatives\u201d), or that reveals, discloses, incorporates, is based upon, discusses, includes or otherwise involves any confidential or proprietary information of the Company or its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to malign, harm, disparage, defame or damage the reputation or good name of the Citizen A, Company B, its business or any of the Company B Representatives.\n\n\nAlso, it's in the US.

Admittedly shocked, he spoke to the manager of that restobar to find out why, and was informed that due to other peace-disturbing, presumably single males (who caused fights and such), they had to implement such a rule.\n\n\nThis restobar is privately owned, but is open to the public without restriction (i.e. doesn't require membership like a club, and such).\n\n\nI understand that almost every place of entertainment across the globe displays this \"Rights to admission reserved\" disclaimer. However, the second clause of [Article 15 of the Constitution of India](http://india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi_part_full.pdf) says:\n\n\n\n> \n> No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place\n>  of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability,\n>  restriction or condition with regard to -\n> \n> \n> 1. access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment; or\n> 2. the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or\n>  dedicated to the use of general public.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnd then clause three of the same article goes on to say:\n\n\n\n> \n> Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any\n>  special provision for women and children.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThus, by my understanding, the above-mentioned restobar's rule of not allowing single males in is illegal according to the Constitution of India.\n\n\nAm I correct to arrive at this conclusion?

These I take to have been administrative divisions of the country. Congress passed an \"organic act\" for each such territory that said the government in this territory shall be organized in thus-and-such manner. During the existence of such a territory, if it was decided to change the term served by the governor from two years to fours year, or make some other change, the change was enacted by Congress, not by the voters in the territory. The constitution of a state, by contrast, is drafted by politicians in that state and submitted for the approval of the voters, and any changes are made by popular vote; there is no involvement of Congress or anything at the federal level. Thus states are not administrative divisions of the federal government. Counties, in those states where they exist (or parishes in Louisiana or boroughs in Alaska), are administrative divisions of the state.\n\n\nThus it seems appropriate that in the U.S., states get \"admitted\" by Congress whereas territories get \"organized\" by Congress. However, in Canada, if I'm not mistaken, both provinces and territories get \"admitted\".\n\n\nSo\n\n\n* Is this understanding of the concept of \"administrative division\" right?\n* Is the article about Quebec right?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

{"text": "How to negotiate a payment for copyright infringement?\nI am looking for some advice on copyright infringement.\nWe are an independent media run by volunteers and have not income, assets or offices at all. Therefore the staff varies. One of the volunteer download a photo from a blog that it seemed to be free use (the photo has been published hundreds of times in blogs that doesn\u2019t ask for copyright) and we published the photo thinking it was OK. \n\n\nBut weeks ago a company called Copytrack emailed us and asked for money for the copyright infringement. So, I do some research, and found that indeed the use of the photo needed a license but when it was downloaded by the volunteer it was from a blog. So, it was a real mistake, but also an unintentional copyright infringement. So I remove the pic and article in full and I sent an email apologising for the mistake and even I offer to do an interview to the photographer or something similar, as we don\u2019t have money.\n\n\nThey replied in identical terms they told @user1889580 \u201cyou have infringed on our client's image, pay us right away to avoid legal issues\u201d, etc.\n\n\nSo, I reply with a more comprehensive letter, apologising again, explaining that we don\u2019t\u2019 receive money, plus we never make any profit from the work we published. Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. \n\n\nThey haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. \n\n\nThe amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. \n\n\nI am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. \n\n\nI have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it. But like @user1889580 , I am worried. I am ready to pay, but to be honest the blog doesn\u2019t have money and me either, so I I have asked for a symbolic fee or for the minimum amount. \n\n\nI am still checking and doing some research but I would appreciate your advice.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": -1}

Family members contacted us and indicated they were coming home to the city we were moving to, had nowhere to come home to, and wondered if they could live with us when they got home. We discussed it several times by facetime and Facebook messenger. It was agreed that instead of an apartment we would rent a house so that when they got home, there was room for them. We'd all live in the house together, they'd start paying rent as soon as they got settled, found jobs etc, and then at some point in the future, probably after the lease expired, we'd go our separate ways.\n\n\nWe started renting the house in Sep 2017, they got delayed and didn't get home until Jan. We were perfectly fine with that we actually moved early for our own reasons. They lived with us for 2 months, didn't pay a penny of rent, and you guessed it they bailed on us, with no notice, and got their own apartment. While I assume the reason they left is irrelevant, we don't know, they didn't give us a reason, in fact there has been no communication in the 2 months since they left. 2 weeks prior to them leaving they asked me to give them a list of the costs of the house as they were about to start working(one of them) and be able to contribute and they wanted to get an idea what it cost. So I typed out on a computer the numbers and gave it to them. That's the only written confirmation beyond the messages on FB messenger, of an agreement. The only other \"proof\" that I can come up with is that they did change of address forms and still have mail coming to the house which proves they fully intended to move in and live there.\n\n\nAgain I have no intent of actually filing, they're family and I'm chalking it up to a lesson learned(for us, clearly not them) but my take is there was a clear contract, they breached it, and under the law they're legally bound to be paying us \"part\" of the rent, and even though they left, they continue to be bound to pay until the lease expires, in Sept 2018.\n\n\nAm I correct or incorrect that there was a contract and it was breached?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

I am also working under the assumption that there is no other meta-data, such as a spreadsheet that links image filenames to the person depicted. \n\n\nGDPR makes clear ([Recital 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)) that anonymous data is not covered by the regulations:\n\n\n\n> \n> \u201c\u2026 The principles of data protection should [therefore] not apply to\n>  anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an\n>  identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\n>  anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer\n>  identifiable.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nData protection considerations would be significantly reduced if these datasets were considered out of scope of GDPR. Is it possible, however, for a face image in isolation to be considered truly anonymised? It would always be feasible to link it to a real person, because most people are capable of recognising faces. With the image, and the person standing in a crowd, it is likely that the average viewer could identify the depicted person.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 7}

If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 4}

But we can imagine getting either a free-form copyright complaint or one according to some other law (e.g. a DMCA notice). \n\n\nAre we expected to react to a non-conforming copyright request? Do the same rules work as for the standard Abmahnung, or is there some other procedure? Or can we ignore anything which does not fulfill the legal requirements of an Abmahnung? Also, if there is some definition of what a valid Abmahnung should contain, where do we find that definition? \n\n\nOur application will contain scientific material, and the copyright holders will be mostly scientific publishers who have the staff to write a proper Abmahnung. But there are also people who self-publish articles or books and they could try writing one on their own. We don't want to be found guilty of neglecting a valid complaint just because it looked amateurish, but also don't want to massively remove legit content because of someone's claims. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 3}

For instance, let's say that Bob has had to spend 5 hours a week stocking the coolers and freezers and 10 hours a week stocking water for 2 years, while Adam who has the same job title as Bob has rarely had to perform such work in the same time period (assume less than 2% of total hours worked), instead Adam does the easier tasks such as stocking chips, cosmetics products, and diapers. The reason the employer provides for this allocation is that Bob is more physically capable of doing hard work. \n\n\nIt seems to me that in such a case, Bob is being mistreated. He deserves an equal share of the easier tasks as Adam, and if the employer wants Bob to do the hard work, they should create a separate job title for him that imposes higher qualifications that ensures that those under the same job title are able to share the work equally. \n\n\nBy denying Bob access to working conditions comparable to Adam's, the employer is essentially denying him a job for which he is overqualified. And in doing so, the employer is able to get Bob's more rare labor for the same price as Adam's less valuable labor. \n\n\nLet's also assume Bob and Adam belong to the same protected classes. \n\n\nAs I understand it, Title VII and FEHA do not protect Bob from refusing, since he belongs to all the same classes as Adam. \n\n\nThis doesn't make much sense to me because if the employer had divided the tasks along protected class lines (i.e., gender or race) rather than by physical ability, then Bob would be protected. \n\n\nThe irony that I've noticed is that the very laws that were passed to protect qualified workers from discrimination now excuse discrimination against qualified workers. \n\n\nAre there other laws that protect Bob from such discrimination that does not require a showing of discrimination based on protected class? Maybe an implied term in the employment contract?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

Though the newness of the offence means there aren't many cases on the subject, the [guidance from the Cheshire Police](https://www.cheshire.police.uk/advice-and-support/domestic-abuse/recognising-the-signs-of-domestic-abuse/), though hardly legally binding, indicates that it would be a crime to withhold affection in an attempt to punish one's partner.\n\n\nIndeed, it's easy to see how, in colloquial rather than legal terms, deliberately withholding sex could be an attempt to coerce one's partner, and abusive. The linked definition in the Serious Crime Act covers any behaviour designed to have a serious coercive or controlling effect on their partner, which is so extremely broad that deliberately withholding sex as coercive quasi-blackmail clearly seems to qualify.\n\n\nYet, accepting that this abusive behaviour constitutes a crime would suggest that people in a relationship are obliged to periodically have sex, even if one of the people wishes not to (albeit for malicious reasons). That would be repugnant, and undo the precedent of R v R [1991] UKHL 12, which clarified (shockingly late) that marital rape is a crime in England and Wales.\n\n\nLeaving aside the practical objection that the Crown would be unlikely to find a prosecution for just withholding sex as in the public interest, in this conflict of laws, which \"wins\"?

Has Y then infringed copyright (assuming it is not considered fair use)?\n\n\n[This answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/25830) presents the following argument:\n\n\n* Installing the software constituted making a copy of it.\n* This copy was only authorized by X on the condition that Y complies with the terms of service.\n* This condition was not met, so the copy was not authorized, so it infringed copyright.\n\n\nThis surprised me since I imagined (maybe incorrectly, IANAL) copyright infringement to be a more serious issue than ToS violation. [This article](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e4b1226a-b6b4-4915-8897-a8e474060481) also seems to contradict the above:\n\n\n\n> \n> However, if a company violates a license by, for example, failing to purchase additional licenses through the publisher, instead of through an otherwise authorized reseller, then the violation could form the basis of a breach-of-contract claim, but not a copyright claim \u2013 none of the exclusive rights would be affected by failure to follow specified payment or transaction terms.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

{"text": "In what situations is it a crime to provide an [EDIT: Image of possibly non-existent] fake or altered US gov't ID in digital form to a company\nIn particular, were a company to require (perhaps unreasonably) a copy of some kind of government identification, such as a Driver's License, is it illegal to produce a fake digital image of an identification document?\n\n\nI have seen this answer: [Is it legal to submit fake digital identification documents to private companies?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5017/is-it-legal-to-submit-fake-digital-identification-documents-to-private-companies)\n\n\nBut it was not clear to me what the definition of 'fake identification document' is. Would an image depicting a 'supposed' (but non-existent) identification document constitute an identification document? My understanding is that producing such an image and sending it (digitally) is not a crime. However I suspect this is incorrect and has been covered/clarified somewhere, so hoping someone can point me in the right direction.\n\n\nI do notice that the answer to the above question cites a section that refers to a definition of identification document:\n\n\n\n> \n> (3)the term \u201cidentification document\u201d means a document made or issued by or under the authority of the United States Government, a State, political subdivision of a State, a sponsoring entity of an event designated as a special event of national significance, a foreign government, political subdivision of a foreign government, an international governmental or an international quasi-governmental organization which, when completed with information concerning a particular individual, is of a type intended or commonly accepted for the purpose of identification of individuals;\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAnd furthermore, \n\n\n\n> \n> (4)the term \u201cfalse identification document\u201d means a document of a type intended or commonly accepted for the purposes of identification of individuals that\u2014 (A)is not issued by or under the authority of a governmental entity or was issued under the authority of a governmental entity but was subsequently altered for purposes of deceit; and (B)appears to be issued by or under the authority of the United States Government, a State, a political subdivision of a State, a sponsoring entity of an event designated by the President as a special event of national significance, a foreign government, a political subdivision of a foreign government, or an international governmental or quasi-governmental organization;\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nI do not know much about law, so it is not clear to me whether a digital image depicting an identification document is considered an identification document; and for example, whether such an image would be \"of a type intended or commonly accepted for the purposes of identification of individuals\", since it is an image and not an actual identification document. For example, such an image would not be sufficient for retailers bound to verify ID (e.g. liquor), DMV and various commercial entities entrusted to issue automotive registration documents, police officers, TSA agents, CBP agents, etc; in those situations (which surely comprise the majority of the possible identification-verification scenarios), such a digital image is not \"intended or commonly accepted for the purposes of identification of individuals\".\n\n\nThanks\n\n\nEdit \nSome clarification to make this question and my motivation clearer. \nThe prototypical example (and what got me thinking of this) was a friend of mine who made a purchase of a few hundred dollars at an online clothing retailer located outside of the US. After the purchase, the retailer followed up indicating they required a scan/fax of driver's license, and some other piece of information I forgot. She did not send it (so the transaction was cancelled), since it would be inadvisable to send such a piece of information not only over email (which is likely, though not necessarily secure) and into an organization with unknown data-handling practices, in another country, etc.\n\n\nWith this example in mind, I am curious as to whether it would be legal to create and submit an *image of/depicting a non-existent identification document*, to a company, perhaps such a company as I have cited. Whether this constitutes a false ID document is not clear, except for example in the case of Virginia which was highlighted by a contributor below, since Virginia considers a false 'facsimile' of the ID document to be a false ID document and therefore illegal.\n\n\nIt has been claimed in the comments that this would be fraud, but I unfortunately do not know what a definitive definition of fraud would be as it applies to this situation. The definition of fraud I read is from Wikipedia: \n\n\n\n> In law, fraud is deliberate deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right.\n\n\nit is not clear to me whether, for example in the clothing retailer example, the individual who transmits the image depicting the non-existent ID is securing an unfair or unlawful gain. Perhaps the retailer is being deprived of a legal right, but I am not certain.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 0}

Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...\n\n\nHowever, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen. She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.\n\n\nFederal law states [it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html)\n\n\nI'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).\n\n\n1. Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship\n\n\nIf the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:\n\n\n\t* Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.\n\t* Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.\n\t* Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago\n\t* Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.\n2. Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.\n\n\nWould Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: \n\n\n\t* The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home\n\t* The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship?\n\t* Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)\n\t* Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.\n\n\nI realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason. I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right? That's something I really didn't need to know about. I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...\n\n\npps. Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 8}

{"text": "alternatives to other party signing a contract\nWhat can bind a party to a contract other than executing it by signing it by hand or electronically and delivering it? My question is only about this element in making a contract, not consideration or other elements. The other topic cited mentions that signing per se is not required, but something is, and therein is my question.\n\n\nI'm thinking of a situation in which person A imposes a burden on person B and person B wants to be paid for fulfilling that burden, but person A would decline to sign a contract, claims the burden is mandatory when it's not, and might worsen the burden if asked, so isn't asked to.\n\n\nExample: If someone visits a doctor for an office consultation, gets the consultation, and leaves and then the doctor sends a bill to the visitor, the fact that neither one ever discussed a contract or a price and that the office had no price posted would be irrelevant and a court would rule that the visitor owed. Maybe that's the case only for medicine and some other professions and not for, say, home party hosts, although I think that could be answered by establishing, somehow, that the service provider's service is commercially valuable and deserving of compensation even if the provider is not classified as a professional.\n\n\nIn one case, a jury was persuaded by a photo of a handshake. The parties were major companies, one well known and the other able to build or buy a factory for a big contract. I've also run into people who try not to sign anything due to a religious reason (I think), but they doubtless enter into contracts and execute them somehow, but I don't know how.\n\n\nHypothetical case: In the U.S., a person writes a letter to a carpenter known to make a living as a carpenter. (Any occupation will do for this purpose, especially one for which compensation is not always expected, such as house-cleaning.) Both are adult individuals. In the letter, the person asks the carpenter to make a chair. Assume nothing else is in the letter. The carpenter makes the chair and delivers it. The carpenter bills the person for the service. The person says there was no intention to make a purchase, just a thought that the carpenter would like to practice making a chair and seeing someone gladly sit in it. The person has sat in it, is glad for the experience, and happily accepts the chair as a gift. The carpenter never said anything about a gift.

{"text": "Is it legal to have a \"Create custom x\" in your D&D program, if that can result in the enduser violating the copyright?\nFirst an introduction to what i am doing! I am creating a tool for players and DMs of D&D. The reason i've been trying to understand the copyright law in regards to this issue is that upon using any information from the books created by WotC you'd violate their copyright. Luckily, WotC has a \"Open Gaming License\" that you can use, to have much of the rules, items and monsters in your book, program, etc. for free (Link to the link of the SRD-OGL: <http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd>)\n\n\nMy issue is that WotC has intentionally left out some of the unique monsters that they themselves has created over the years. Which in itself is fine, but i have no idea if i would violate their copyright for these unique monsters if i were to create a module in my program where the enduser would be able to build a custom monster from a blank template (name: input here, armor class: input here etc. - you can look at an example on, say, page 279 with the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here name would be Tyrannosaurus Rex and Armor class would be 13 (natural armor))\n\n\nIf the enduser were to create a totally custom, madeup creature i'd imagine that tool would be fine, but i can also see the scenario where a enduser could copy letter for letter the information of a copyrighted monster into my custom monster template and essentially adding a copyright-violating item into the program.\n\n\nSo. I guess in essence what i am asking is: By making a tool in my program that can enable the user to create their own monsters, will i then be in trouble because i've also, if the user is malicious, by extension enabled the user to violate the copyright of WotC?\n\n\nI am from Denmark if that makes any difference, which i'd guess it doesn't. \nI have no real legal experience which is why i thought it'd be a good place to ask such a question.

{"text": "Employer forcing everyone to sign new contract which significantly affects working hours\nMy employer has recently undergone a number of changes internally, involving the move to different premises (with the argument about the new building being larger, however will accommodate roughly the same number of staff as the current building will occupy). As part of this, they have sent around an update to the employment contract which basically nullifies the flexible working hours which previously has been in effect. Many people I work with vary their working hours to fit in with their lives, and has been accepted - up to this point.\n\n\nThe business operated a core working hours of 10am to 4pm, but are changing this to 9am - 5pm, with a 30 minute \"flexible start/end\" that employees can start and end their working day (e.g; 8.30am to 5pm, or 9am to 5.30pm) - effectively removing the concept of flexible working hours completely. This affects many people's lives, and some of my colleagues are petitioning to retain their flexible working hours, of which are being met with strict rules surrounding a mandatory lunch hour/half hour, no option to work less than this to make up the time (despite being willing to), and one has been forced to drop their hours to 36/week.\n\n\nThey also put in a clause to the portion that they're wanting everyone to sign which says that everyone must specify when, between the hours to 12pm to 2pm, they will take their lunch, and must be rigid over this (unless a meeting is occurring, in which case that overrides your lunch hour and you must take it later). This was also met with protest, and they eventually caved and relaxed this rigidity slightly, then sent across some minutes from that meeting ratifying this. They will not, however, update the contract to reflect this as they've said that the meeting minutes ratifies it. However, we don't believe this would ever stand up in court if a dispute ever arose. Is this true?\n\n\nThe final part of this demands flexibility from the employee for the business's requirements (e.g; if a meeting runs late/starts early, the employee is expected to be there), but will not offer the same level of flexibilities to staff who currently have lives (unless they offer a rigid, business-valid justification for doing so). It's almost as if they're \"offering\" this 30 minutes of flexibility to save face because on paper the revision is a load of rubbish.\n\n\nMany people do not want to sign this, as it significantly affects their lives (I myself work earlier in the morning to finish at 4pm to miss rush hour traffic in both directions, and so I have a little bit of daylight left at the end of the day - however I've been told that I would not be able to petition for flexible working hours with these reasons as they are not valid and would be rejected..and have also been told that I would be one of the worst affected by the change in rules). The move to the new building also offers no car parking space, so those that currently park on the company's property are effectively having to take a pay cut in order to pay for parking, or obtain an alternative means of getting to the office - usually at the additional expensive of significantly increased commute times.\n\n\nMy question is basically this - Can they legally do this? What are the options for employees if they disagree to the new rigid rules and will (or have) get a formal request for flexible working hours rejected because their reasons are not \"valid\" in the eyes of the business? If the company lets staff go as a result of not agreeing to these rigid terms, are there grounds for constructive/unfair dismissal?\n\n\nSorry I've rambled on a bit, but it's quite difficult to get a lot of this across.

{"text": "Can a business unilaterally change a contract?\nSuppose a customer enters into a lease- or subscription-type agreement with a business, where the business either provides a physical thing that the customer takes and uses, or the business does a thing for the customer such as mows the lawn every other week, or provides the customer with remote access to something such as internet access, web service hosting, or some online content-access service: the point is that the customer need never see or interact with any person from the business, after the agreement is reached. What passes for a written agreement simply states that the business provides that access or use of the thing to the customer for 1 year, and the customer pays a specified fee which is due up front (and was paid). There is, in particular, no clause allowing either party to terminate the contract with or without a refund (pro-rated or otherwise), no clause allows either party to unilaterally change the terms of the agreement, and no clause requires the parties to renegotiate if one side wants something.\n\n\nHowever, there is also nothing that *prohibits* one party from attempting to modify the terms of the agreement. The business could propose a new term in the contract, and the customer might accept that term. I am interested in the case where the business sets forth a new term, and the customer is not interested. The customer might explicitly reject the new term; if he does not explicitly reject the term, and also does not explicitly accept it, does silence have the same effect as explicit rejection? To be concrete about the new term, assume that it is a clause about the agreement and not the service, so for example a mandatory arbitration clause, a waiver of liability, or a non-disparagement clause.\n\n\nIn this scenario, the customer has a continuing right to that service, and by accessing the web site, using the equipment or allowing the mowers to mow the lawn as usual, it is reasonable to assume that they are simply exercising their rights under the old contract, and have not implicitly accepted the new terms. On the other hand, it might not be inconceivable that the courts have discovered an obligation to explicitly respond, whereby failing to reject is as good as accepting. Is it a clearly settled matter of law how silence along with continued use of the paid-for service is treated? (I\u2019m looking for a leading case citation: US law if there's a difference between US and the rest of the common law world).\n\n\nThere is a general [Prescott v. Jones](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3574312/prescott-v-jones/), 41 A. 352 (N.H. 1898), exemplified in insurance contracts, that\n\n\n\n> \n> it is well settled that \"a party cannot, by the wording of his offer,\n>  turn the absence of communication of acceptance into an acceptance,\n>  and compel the recipient of his offer to refuse it at the peril of\n>  being held to have accepted it\"\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThere is a realm of \"exceptions\" with [National Union Fire Insurance v. Ehrlich](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/2161), where an insurance contract had ended and the company sent a renewal offer along with a bill (which was 2 months later rejected). The court ruled in favor of the company, citing Williston On Contracts:\n\n\n\n> \n> Generally speaking an offeree has a right to make no reply to offers.\n>  But the relations between the parties may have been such as to have\n>  justified the offeror in expecting a reply. *When property is sent to\n>  another though not ordered but under such circumstances that the\n>  latter knows that payment is expected, the silent acceptance of the\n>  property is in effect an assent to the offer of sale implied by the\n>  sending of the property*.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSee also [Austin v. Burge, 137 S.W. 618](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/2155) for renewal of a newspaper subscription. These kinds of cases fall outside of the scope of this question, for two reasons. First, they involve a customer using the service when they have no existing contractual right to do so, second, automatic renewals are commonplace and to be expected, whereas one party unilaterally changing a contract is not at all commonplace. In the situation covered by the question, the customer is still within the period of the existing contract. \n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 2}

{"text": "Could asking an author for a copy of their research article be illegal?\nI've been following [an interesting Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/710834488645816321) which raised the idea that merely *asking* a researcher for a copy of a paper they've written could be against the law. From the linked tweet:\n\n\n\n> \n> you would be soliciting the violation of the law by requesting access to a copyrighted work\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nI guess the argument is the following: in the process of publication, authors typically transfer ownership of the copyright in their paper to the publishing journal. Sometimes the copyright transfer agreement specifies that the author retains the right to distribute copies of the paper, and sometimes it does not. If the agreement does not have this provision, it is being argued that asking the author for something they do not have the right to distribute could be contributory copyright infringement. Especially if you (the requesting third party) know - or believe - that the author doesn't have the right to redistribute the paper. It's worth noting here that most publishers put the standard copyright transfer agreement they ask authors to sign on their website, and authors are typically somewhat familiar with the standard agreements used by the journals they read and publish in.\n\n\nThis sounds rather crazy. I find it hard to believe that a simple informal request (which the author is free to deny, of course) could be against the law. Then again, that doesn't keep it from being true.\n\n\nI'm sure it will take a court to definitively decide this issue, but I want to ask here, is it even *plausible* that making such a request would, in fact, be found to constitute contributory copyright infringement or some other violation of that nature? Or is there no realistic way it would happen? I'm especially interested in answers that can cite relevant references, statute or case law or whatever, that would likely influence the decision in a hypothetical case testing the issue. As far as I know this has never actually come up in a case, so there may not be much to cite, but if there is, it would be a very satisfying answer. This question is as much about supporting the answer as it is about getting one in the first place.\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 16}

(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine>)\n\n\nThe First Sale Doctrine says, that the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute a particular copy ends once they make it's first sale. So e.g. a copyright owner cannot stop a buyer of a book of theirs from reselling this particular copy of the book, while still retaining the right to stop the buyer from copying the book.\n\n\nNow, one could argue that distributing the file and allowing others to make physical copies from that file would be similar to a first sale and thus allow the owner of the physical copy of the object to resell it.\n\n\nIf that's not the case, what else can the copyright owner restrict the license taker restrict from doing? Would it be possible to restrict the license taker to only print the file e.g. using a specific brand of filament? Can the copyright owner dictate terms of use for 3D printed objects derived from their file?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": -1}

Until 2004 there was no legal version of these books available anywhere, yet it was impossible to be a professional jazz musician without one. So people copied and/or sold them illegally.

The real\n>  issue here however was whether Panatown could rely on a special rule traceable back to *Dunlop\n>  v Lambert* in 1839 and referred to in *The Albazero* (1977) by Lord Diplock in relation to contracts\n>  for the carriage of goods.

I've recently run into a major German ISP blocking my site (this is a new thing; I used to send to their customers with no problem) and interrupting communication with one of their customers I need to correspond with.\n\n\nAfter a few weeks of back-and-forth with their email engineering contact giving me moving-goalposts/bait-and-switch about what they want me to do to get unblocked from their system, they are now insisting that I publish legal name and physical street address for the responsible party (that would be me personally) on the web as a condition to access their service.\n\n\nIs this sort of requirement legal under the GDPR? I could understand (while strongly objecting to, but that's not part of the legal question here) \"sorry, we won't open our service to you\", but making an offer to provide access but making it conditional on what amounts to doxing oneself seems like it should not be legal. Is this (demanding I publish it publicly rather than give them the same information privately) some loophole for skirting around the GDPR? Is there anything else legally sketchy about the demand?\n\n\nI am not in Germany; the other party involved is.\n\n\nMore details copied from clarifying comments I posted on an answer (sorry, some of this is technical and may not be useful to non-IT folks):\n\n\n\n> \n> The data was requested after a long series of individual email exchanges with their email engineering department (which has its own separate mail system that's not blocking my site). No emails were flagged as spam and no spam has ever been sent from my site to their mail system. (Fewer than 50 total emails have ever been sent from my site to them.) They seem to have instituted their own in-house policy for IP addresses to accept from based on IP block ownership data (note: not using any of the well-run RBL/DUL type lists) and allow-listing well-known sites.\n> \n> \n> Rejection takes place before the SMTP session even begins (error message prior to EHLO, giving the address of the email engineering department which I then contacted). Initial request was that I provide \"full contact info\" on webserver associated with domain the IP address reverses to in order to be unblocked, with no indication of what that would entail. Eventually after being (apparently intentionally) vague for a long time they started insisting that include physical street address. \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nBasically, the actionable thing I want to know is whether I have grounds to say something like \"The offer to accept mail from my site under the conditions of having published physical contact information constitutes a solicitation for personal data protected by GDPR, and if you are soliciting such personal data, you are required by law to accept it via a secure and private channel.\"\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 6}

Walter tries to wake up Jesse shaking him strongly without success. Doing that he modified slightly the position of Jessie and a conseguence (since she was in a sort of hug with him) Jane. In particular now she is on her back. It is not clear if she had a pillow on her back to avoid this position. Some time before, Jesse had explained to Walter that in this situation the pillow is important, since it keeps you on your side and not in your back, so if you vomit you avoid choking to death.

At first Walter tries to react, running to the other side of the bed to help her, but then he stops and decides to do nothing as she dies.\n\n\nWhat is this? Homicide? Voluntary?

So, maybe that answers my question - but I don't know the legal definition of contraband. Stolen property may be contraband (having a motorcycle certainly isn't) but the police can't show that the motorcycle was stolen, because legally, they can't use any evidence they have of it (fruit of the poisoned tree).\n\n\nI guess if the cops keep the motorcycle, and the man then tried to claim it, they could get him for receiving stolen property again (new case), but the man who owns it probably wants his bike back.

{"text": "Would police in the US have any alternative for handling a confiscated computer with a hidden partition?\nI've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n\n", "source": "law_stack_exchange", "score": 4}
