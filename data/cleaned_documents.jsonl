I don't mean to make this question become too broad, so we are still dealing with the original problem: *whether browser cache violates (US and EU) copyright laws in theory*. I do hope this is a [good subjective question](https://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/).\n\n\nPlease be aware that I believe the term *Intellectual Property*, which appeared in the comments, [to be misleading](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.en.html). It refers to patents, trademarks, copyright and other stuff, while we're just discussing about copyright here.\n\n\n**Quotes from answer and comments:**\n\n\n* > \n> Copyright is not about copying, it is about use (Jon Story)\n> \n> \n>\n* > \n> Many misconceptions are based on copyright being about use.

(kasperd)\n> \n> \n>\n\n\n**FURTHER UPDATE:**\n\n\nI'm going to start a bounty on this question. Here I add the parts of the current answer (Jon Story's) I'm less satisfied with:\n\n\n\n> \n> Because you are not duplicating the content or re-publishing it\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nI'm clearly doing the first of these two things.\n\n\n\n> \n> The web page is publicly available anyway (or at least, accessible by\n>  you), so you have permission to read it: copyright is about whether\n>  you have permission to access and read the file, not about whether you\n>  have permission to make a copy of the file as part of the technical\n>  process of accessing and reading it.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nI'm almost certain that copyright is not about the permission to read and access the text, but about the permission of making copies, modifying, redistributing and other stuff like that. For instance, I don't think you can make a copyright note that does not allow reading your content. Is fair use the key point here? That may be, and in the comments I was almost convinced. However, I've never known that fair use could justifiy copying the *entire* text.

{"text":"Is it a crime to falsely claim to have committed a crime to someone not a legal authority?\nI've been wondering about this. I know that, say, it is generally a crime to file a false police report, and the motivation for this seems logical because that it wastes police time and resources - and thus takes them away from being able to spend them on real leads, and thus also to degrade the public safety by that little bit.\n\n\nBut I also know that, if one admits to making a crime on a public forum, such as an Internet forum, it is possible that a prosecutor who is looking at such fora could potentially use the admission to bring charges, even if the admission is not specifically directed toward one. However, what I wonder about is if some of the above logic does not also, then, apply to a situation like this: if one were to, given this fact, *falsely* announce on such a forum that one had committed a crime that one actually did not, could it amount to having the same effect of wasting prosecutor/law enforcement time albeit in a more indirect way that sneaks through their attitudes, and thus potentially also be considered some kind of crime?\n\n\n(I want to point out I'm not referring to making a false claim to be the perpetrator of a known crime, or to falsely claim someone else is that perpetrator to, say, get reward money. I'm referring specifically to announcing an *unknown* crime one did not commit, a crime that does not exist, on a public venue like a forum that is not *specifically* a channel to police or other authorities.

{"text":"Noncompete, nonsolicit, nondisclose agreement company that was sold. But wait, there's more\nThis all happens in Minnesota. \n\n\nEmployee E worked for company A and had standard noncompete agreement. Agreement has an assignment clause assigning rights to any successor. Company B buys most business units of company A and hires most employees. Seller of A starts new company N. E stays with seller of A and works for new company N. Assume it's clear that language of noncompete contract assigned to B all rights of all of A's employees who now work for B. \n\n\nA was in the business of providing medical billing services to hospitals. E worked in that industry when hired by A. During employment E developed a product to detect fraud within hospitals and stopped working on billing and started working on the product. When B buys A, it only buys the billing business. Seller of A starts new business explicitly to sell fraud product and invites E to come along. There is an implied option for E to stay on and work for B, but B does not express interest in E and has no contact with E before the sale. Seller has an explicit new agreement with B (it is specific to seller the person) that seller will not engage in medical billing business. E has no new agreement. \n\n\nSeller commences new business N. E has no new agreement or paperwork with N. Not even a tax form. N is a small company and does not provide health insurance but since E received benefits under his spouse's employer there was no change in status in that regard. The only change is that auto deposit pay checks were now from N. \n\n\nHospital who previously worked with seller at company A contacts seller, asking for consulting work on a billing problem. Because of seller's agreement with B, the consulting contract is written between hospital and B, with N working under a separate agreement with B. Basically N does all the work while B prints invoices and sends 50% of money to N. \n\n\nSeller goes to hospital and brings E along for the consulting job. In the course of the work, hospital offers E a job. Not just a job, the job - the one that's being filled by the contract work. Counsel for hospital sees no problem with the offer as it relates to hospital's actions and let's assume that's a correct assessment. But what about E? \n\n\nIs there any legal doctrine whereby E's agreement with A continued to apply to E in his work for company N? What about B? Do they have any standing to block E's going to work for a B's customer? My thinking here is that E technically has a noncompete agreement with B but perhaps there is a generally accepted public policy theory whereby employers can't enforce agreements against former employees especially under these facts. \n\n\nReasonable minds may suggest that neither B nor N have an interest in blocking the employment. But let's assume seller is pissed bc now E won't be available to develop product for N and B is pissed because the hiring stops the gravy train and cuts off future potential work. \n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/177","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":3,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9781395196914673}}

{"text":"How does one determine if illegal goods were accepted if an individual who has both legal and illegal source of income pays another party?\nLets say that an individual, Bob, has a regular job which covers his daily expenses, but also has an illegal side job. A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities. Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit/debit card.\n\n\nI'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned. I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.\n\n\nA few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:\n\n\nI assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.\n\n\nLikewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.\n\n\nHowever, what about a more ambiguous case. If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/224","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":4,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9938932061195374}}

{"text":"Are perpetual contracts enforceable?\nContracts generally have terminations clauses allowing either party to eventually end the obligation imposed on them by a contract. E.g. the buyer may have to notify the seller of termination in writing; the service may, at its sole discretion, terminate a user for breaking the rules; the agreement may terminate on a specific date and so on. In principle, a contract could be written in such a way that the service has the right to terminate the agreement, but the customer cannot terminate the agreement (so they are stuck with that cell service provider for life). Assume that the contracts in question are contracts of adhesion (take it or leave it, customer). In the scenario, (1) there may be an explicit statement that the customer is perpetually bound or (2) there is no statement regarding termination by the customer: I assume the answer is different depending on whether the contract is silent.\n\n\nIs there any statutory or case law that addresses the enforceability of perpetual contracts (general common law, unless the answer is too jurisdiction in which case US)?

{"text":"Would police in the US have any alternative for handling a confiscated computer with a hidden partition?\nI've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/305","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":4,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9745001196861267}}

I'm aware the copyright holder can stop the work from being distributed and take it down, as well as claim damages that the derived work may have caused.\n\n\nThis question comes from a recent controversy where Disney started selling a toy made from a 3d model that they took from a fan work made by an internet user.

Suppose a person puts an obscene story on a website (we'll call them the Writer) and another person reads the story (we'll call them the Reader). \n\n\nIs the Reader guilty of 'publishing' the material and therefore in breach of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act?\n\n\nIn the normal sense, 'publication' is defined in an online context as \n\n\n\"*to submit (content) online*, as to a message board or blog: I published a comment on her blog post with examples from my own life.\" \naccording to www.dictionary.com (emphasis added is mine). \n\n\nIn the context of the Obscene Publications Act, the word 'publishes' seems to have been redefined, appropriated to become a piece of legalese that no longer reflects the original meaning of the word. The wording of the Act states (emphasis mine) -\n\n\n(3)For the purposes of this Act a person publishes an article who—\n\n\n(a)distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire; or\n\n\n(b)in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it [F1, **or, where the matter is data stored electronically, transmits that data**.]:\n\n\n. . . F2\n\n\nWhat does it mean to 'transmit' that data? Regina vs Waddon has shown that transmission is said to have occurred when the data is uploaded to the Website by the Author or downloaded from the Website by the Reader. In both those instances, the Author was deemed to have 'published' the article. (The reason it mattered was that although the Website was hosted abroad, the UK-resident Author had still broken the UK law when the material was downloaded in the UK so he could therefore be prosecuted). \n\n\nBut what about the Reader? ...

And communities like this one are basically allowing users to embed third party assets.\n\n\n**Who's responsible for this?** Is it the user's fault, because they should always make sure the image source complies with the GDPR? I doubt it. The website owner's fault (Stackexchange), because they should not allow hotlinking? I'd say yeah, probably. Or the third-party website's fault, for not complying with the GDPR? I'd say no, for all we know they could be based in a country that doesn't even know what the GDPR is.\n\n\nSo my conclusion is that hotlinking should be treated like loading a third-party asset, and if the website owner cannot check the privacy policies of every hotlinked image (for example because it would be impossible in a community like this one), then unsupervised hotlinking should be disabled because the GDPR does not allow it. Am I wrong?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/455","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":4,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.94170081615448}}

{"text":"Ask people for WhatsApp address book consent; what to do when declined?\nI have first posted this question on *Super User*. Since I tagged it with Android (as I use WhatsApp on Android) it got migrated to *Android Enthusiasts*. There one decided that it was not on-topic for that site and got closed. This question does address the technical side of uploading only a partial address book, but it mainly focuses on the legal perspective. So perhaps it is on-topic here.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nA year ago I gave into the nagging and started to use WhatsApp. With the recent update I have agree to new terms of use which contain this (italic emphasis mine):\n\n\n\n> \n> **Address Book.** You provide us the phone numbers of WhatsApp users and your other contacts in your mobile phone address book on a regular basis. You confirm *you are authorized to provide us such numbers* to allow us to provide our Services.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSo in principle I would have to send a message to each and every one of my contacts in order to ask. And while I am at it, I would actually also ask for Telegram, Hangouts, Wire, Skype, Duo, Signal; perhaps just a general authorization would be the easiest.\n\n\nThen I get back a bunch of messages which I archive somewhere securely in care somebody sues me about it. Then I can prove that they gave me permission to upload their contact details. This is just tedious and a lot of work, but technically it can be done.\n\n\nWhat do I do about the people who do not agree? Android 6.0 on my phone does not seem to allow to give only selected contacts to WhatsApp. This means that I would have to delete the number on my phone which sounds utterly inconvenient. My contacts are stored in my Google account. Should I have asked my contacts for that already?\n\n\nIs there anything I can actually do about this? I think my options are the following:\n\n\n1. Continue to use WhatsApp (like virtually everyone else) and ignore that I could potentially be sued by somebody who would not consent to his contact information being uploaded.\n\n\nAs I am a German citizen living in Germany, I am not sure where I would be sued, actually. WhatsApp has no department in Germany, so the US law covers my relationship with WhatsApp. Can another German citizen sue with under US law in Germany? Can only US citizens sue me, would I have to fly to the US? All in all it seems like a non-issue in personal life.\n2. Delete the WhatsApp account (if possible) and not use the service any more. In principle I would have to get rid of all the other messaging apps as well. I couldn't store my contact list in my Google account then either, right? That is also sharing the data with other people.\n3. Attempt to ask every one of my 532 contacts whether it is okay to upload their phone number. Otherwise delete the phone number or the whole contact from my address book. Keep track of these numbers in a paper notebook at home (in a safe).\n\n\nMy actual question: Is the third option actually possible? And what could happen if I stick with option one?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/460","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":2,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9727666974067688}}

The order requires utilities to file tariffs prohibiting monitoring unless notice is given to the parties to the conversation, or their consent is obtained. If a telephone company learns that a customer is monitoring conversations in violation of the tariff, the order requires the utility to discontinue service if the customer does not refrain from such monitoring within five days after notice from the utilities.

They're both working hand in hand against the interests of the employees/dues-paying union members.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nImagine a Corporation (C) that's affiliated with a union (U). They agree on a contract that says extra work should go to more senior people. If the company needs to call people to work an extra shift, it is supposed to call the most senior people first.\n\n\nHowever, the company blatantly ignores the contract, recruiting the LEAST senior people.\n\n\nWhen an employee with seniority with high seniority files a grievance, C and U both lie, intimidate and stonewall. For example, the union claims the company won't give them its payroll records, making it impossible for them to know who worked when. And when the company finally hands the records over - three months later - the union won't let the grievance see the records.\n\n\nThe union also makes grievance jump through all kinds of hoops. If you file a grievance, you're expected to do all the detective work - cite a particular less senior worker, with details (time, date, location) and have it signed by a witness. The irony is that there could be a dozen less senior people who worked that day, a fact the payroll records could easily prove.\n\n\nBut the union refuses to go on a \"fishing expedition.\"\n\n\nLong story short, grievances are typically solved six to nine months after they're filed, and the grievants never expect to get more than about 30% of what they're owed.\n\n\nThe state Dept. of Labor says \"contact the National Labor Board.\" The National Labor Board says a contract - and its interpretation - is between C and U; they can do whatever they want.\n\n\nIs that really the end of the road, or is there some kind of legal or quasi-legal action one could take? If you know the company and union are both withholding information, lying, delaying payouts, etc., can you cite them for violating any particular laws? What about a union that \"interprets\" and enforces the contract two different ways, giving its cronies all their support while thumbing their nose at everyone else?\n\n\nIt appears that the only recourse would be legal action, but it's hard to determine whether any laws have been violated.

The CJEU's [press release (PDF link)](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140054en.pdf) clarifies the retroactive effect of the invalidity in a footnote:\n\n\n\n> \n> Given that the Court has not limited the temporal effect of its judgment, the declaration of invalidity takes effect from the date on which the directive entered into force.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nWhile the DRD entered into force in 2006, the Charter was only formally incorporated into the EU treaty framework on 1 December 2009.

When CJEU invalidates a statute without specifying date, does that really imply complete retroactivity? While this decision is silent about it, is there other case-law that might help here?\n* Has the Charter been determined to have legal force before its formal incorporation by the Treaty of Lisbon? Would that have been the presumably treaty-level force necessary to strike down a Directive?\n* Recital 22 of the DRD specifically cites compliance with Articles 7 & 8 of the Charter, but are recitals a sufficient basis for invalidating the Directive's substantive Articles?

The agent we're going through wanted a holding deposit when we agreed to start the process (fine), which came with an agreement that the deposit is returned if we sign the tenancy agreement (reasonable), but *not* returned if we don't (ok, so they're protecting themselves against some loon block-reserving their entire property listing.

The only thing I can find that relates to my question is information about the strategies of lawyers who defended notorious murderers who were overwhelmingly guilty. I would like the scope of my question to be something less serious and less complicated than that. In most of those cases, the defenses' main goal was to keep them out of a death penalty, and the trials were long and complicated. Also, to be thorough, please feel free to note / comment on any of the following in an answer:\n\n\n* You know there is practically no conceivable defense for your client; how does that change your efforts in plea bargaining?\n* Let's say the prosecutor won't budge - not a single plea offer. You know there is practically no conceivable defense for your client - what do you do when the case goes to trial?\n* At any point, is it a matter of ethics to make it clear to your client that there is no conceivable defense for their case and your primary service as their counsel will be to provide guidance through the confusing and complicated legal / court process and help make sure their rights to a fair trial are upheld?\n* Now suppose you are not necessarily a public defender but a private attorney for hire. Someone comes to you looking to hire you for counsel on the type of charges outlined above. There is little to no conceivable defense. Do you take the case? If so, do you tell them this before negotiating a price?\n\n\nI understand my question is certainly subjective. The answer could vary greatly from case to case, dependent on countless variables. I do, however, still think it is constructive and on topic because it can be answered on a high level as to how to initially assess those variables and form a strategy.

{"text":"At what point does refusal to report a crime make one an accomplice to a crime?\nThis is a question out of curiosity only, indirectly inspired by my [last question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3670/can-you-plead-the-fifth-to-avoid-revealing-the-identity-of-someone-you-were-accu) post. I'm wondering at what point not reporting a crime is itself a crime.\n\n\nI know that if someone happens to witness a bar fight and doesn't immediately call the cops they are not guilty of a crime (or I assume they aren't, unless they're technically guilty and simply never prosecuted for it). This implies that the refusal to report a crime is not, by itself, a crime.\n\n\nHowever, I'm also pretty sure if, for example, a women knows her boyfriend is sexually assaulting their child and turns a blind eye to it she can be convicted as an accomplice to the crime. Likewise, I think if you're riding in the car with someone who does a hit and run you are required to report it or be an accomplice.\n\n\nSo I'm wondering where this line is drawn. At what point does one's involvement become such that they are guilty simply for failing to report another individual, assuming they have not actively done anything to directly support the crime otherwise?\n\n\nFurthermore, if someone is indirectly benefiting from a crime they do not encourage or facilitate – for instance a wife getting a new fur coat after her husband robs a bank despite her not approving of the husband's actions – does this make her an accomplice? Is there a line here to draw, presumably a bar serving a drink to someone they know is a bookie doesn't make them guilty, even if the bookie presumably earned the money he is using to buy the drink via an illegal job?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/960","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":18,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9753985404968262}}

{"text":"Is there a reason lawyers are hesitant to use the media against an adversary?\nI'm not a lawyer, so I'm only familiar with a small cross section of civil suits, but it seems to be a general trend that lawyers are very hesitant to publicize any part of a case. Even when the adversary has huge vulnerabilities because of the nature of the civil suit, the lawyer insists you keep quiet, in order to \"not make them mad.\" Instead, you pay the lawyer to keep filing documents and orders, asking for \"christmas lists,\" etc, while they other side does the same, and in the end, it's often a war of attrition, and the little guy loses. However, anecdotally, it seems that a number of cases resolve themselves within hours or days after an appropriate post on social media or call to a journalist.

This is the data that is usually sent:\n\n\n* Your IP\n* A cookie\n* The URL you are visiting (the URL of this question)\n* Your user-agent (typically including OS version, browser version, etc.)\n* The time when you first saw this picture (header: if-modified-since)\n\n\nThis can definitely be personal data according to the GDPR, and in practice in most cases **it is**.\n\n\n\n> \n> ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThat data is sent somewhere automatically. Did you see any privacy policies? Did you accept anything? No, you don't know how that data will be used. Of course it could be sent to a stupid random website, that will never use it for anything. Or it could be sent to a big corporation, or to a content delivery network, or any website that is big enough to be able to track you with this data, because they have a lot of services (or just hotlinked images) around spread all over the web. Note: the data is actually sent to Imgur, which I believe would definitely be able to track you, given the huge amount of pictures on the internet that link to them.\n\n\nI've always seen people mainly worried about third-party assets (Google Analytics or Facebook buttons, etc.), some also began to worry about Google Fonts (that's a third-party asset too actually), but I don't think anybody ever brought up the issue of hotlinked images. That's third-party stuff. And communities like this one are basically allowing users to embed third party assets.\n\n\n**Who's responsible for this?** Is it the user's fault, because they should always make sure the image source complies with the GDPR? I doubt it. The website owner's fault (Stackexchange), because they should not allow hotlinking? I'd say yeah, probably. Or the third-party website's fault, for not complying with the GDPR? I'd say no, for all we know they could be based in a country that doesn't even know what the GDPR is.\n\n\nSo my conclusion is that hotlinking should be treated like loading a third-party asset, and if the website owner cannot check the privacy policies of every hotlinked image (for example because it would be impossible in a community like this one), then unsupervised hotlinking should be disabled because the GDPR does not allow it.

This was deemed to exceed the 2 year duration (2 years + one month without usage, but a signed contract), so the customer was able to terminate the contract earlier than expected.\n\n\nIn my case, I signed a contract on date X, the 2 years started on \"X + 2 weeks\". Then, at \"X + 2 weeks + 2 years\" the contract was automatically extended by one year. This extension was announced in the original contract.\n\n\nMy question is, whether the contract can still be canceled immediately. I can se an argument for both sides:\n\n\n* Yes, it can be canceled: The first contract period was invalid, it became an unlimited contract, cancelable at any time. Therefore, there was no need for an extension. It's still the same contract, so it can be canceled now.\n* No, it cannot be canceled: While the contract could have been canceled during the first 2 years, the extension made this a new contract.

{"text":"Is it a crime to falsely claim to have committed a crime to someone not a legal authority?\nI've been wondering about this. I know that, say, it is generally a crime to file a false police report, and the motivation for this seems logical because that it wastes police time and resources - and thus takes them away from being able to spend them on real leads, and thus also to degrade the public safety by that little bit.\n\n\nBut I also know that, if one admits to making a crime on a public forum, such as an Internet forum, it is possible that a prosecutor who is looking at such fora could potentially use the admission to bring charges, even if the admission is not specifically directed toward one. However, what I wonder about is if some of the above logic does not also, then, apply to a situation like this: if one were to, given this fact, *falsely* announce on such a forum that one had committed a crime that one actually did not, could it amount to having the same effect of wasting prosecutor/law enforcement time albeit in a more indirect way that sneaks through their attitudes, and thus potentially also be considered some kind of crime?\n\n\n(I want to point out I'm not referring to making a false claim to be the perpetrator of a known crime, or to falsely claim someone else is that perpetrator to, say, get reward money.

{"text":"GDPR and CDN (content delivery networks)\nI have a website hosted in a European server. The website is static (serverless) so I can take advantage of a CDN to serve its whole content.\n\n\nA CDN is, basically, a distributed network of servers. That means that a copy of my website would be hosted on several servers around the world. User requests are (ideally) directed to the server which is closest to the user. By doing so, a CDN improves the performance of the site. \n\n\nHow is this relevant concerning the GDPR?\n\n\n1. By using a CDN I'm adding to the system a new third-party that will collect the IP and other metadata from my users. Obviously I can't get consent from the user beforehand: when they hit the server it is already too late.\n2. Probably, users will get routed to a server close to them, but this is not guaranteed. I don't know to which server they are going to connect. I don't even know the country. It could be that a German user end up sending his IP, browser footprint, etc. to a server in Japan (unlikely but possible). Because I don't know it, I can't inform the user about it.\n\n\nMy assumptions are:\n\n\n1. Without CDN, the hosting provider would collect that same data so I don't think there is a relevant difference. I just need to inform my users in the privacy policy which CDN provider I use and that it collects personal data on the basis of legitimate interests (Art.6(1)(f)), as I do with the hosting provider.\n2.

{"text":"Are perpetual contracts enforceable?\nContracts generally have terminations clauses allowing either party to eventually end the obligation imposed on them by a contract.

{"text":"Noncompete, nonsolicit, nondisclose agreement company that was sold. But wait, there's more\nThis all happens in Minnesota. \n\n\nEmployee E worked for company A and had standard noncompete agreement. Agreement has an assignment clause assigning rights to any successor. Company B buys most business units of company A and hires most employees. Seller of A starts new company N. E stays with seller of A and works for new company N. Assume it's clear that language of noncompete contract assigned to B all rights of all of A's employees who now work for B. \n\n\nA was in the business of providing medical billing services to hospitals. E worked in that industry when hired by A. During employment E developed a product to detect fraud within hospitals and stopped working on billing and started working on the product. When B buys A, it only buys the billing business. Seller of A starts new business explicitly to sell fraud product and invites E to come along. There is an implied option for E to stay on and work for B, but B does not express interest in E and has no contact with E before the sale. Seller has an explicit new agreement with B (it is specific to seller the person) that seller will not engage in medical billing business. E has no new agreement. \n\n\nSeller commences new business N. E has no new agreement or paperwork with N. Not even a tax form. N is a small company and does not provide health insurance but since E received benefits under his spouse's employer there was no change in status in that regard. The only change is that auto deposit pay checks were now from N. \n\n\nHospital who previously worked with seller at company A contacts seller, asking for consulting work on a billing problem. Because of seller's agreement with B, the consulting contract is written between hospital and B, with N working under a separate agreement with B. Basically N does all the work while B prints invoices and sends 50% of money to N. \n\n\nSeller goes to hospital and brings E along for the consulting job. In the course of the work, hospital offers E a job. Not just a job, the job - the one that's being filled by the contract work. Counsel for hospital sees no problem with the offer as it relates to hospital's actions and let's assume that's a correct assessment. But what about E? \n\n\nIs there any legal doctrine whereby E's agreement with A continued to apply to E in his work for company N? What about B? Do they have any standing to block E's going to work for a B's customer? My thinking here is that E technically has a noncompete agreement with B but perhaps there is a generally accepted public policy theory whereby employers can't enforce agreements against former employees especially under these facts. \n\n\nReasonable minds may suggest that neither B nor N have an interest in blocking the employment. But let's assume seller is pissed bc now E won't be available to develop product for N and B is pissed because the hiring stops the gravy train and cuts off future potential work. \n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/1327","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":3,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9781395196914673}}

(When working under a service for hire scenario, there is always a written agreement that explicitly denies the recording company the copyright, so I do not want to focus on that).\n\n\nThe recording company is doing the work, creating the original work, without any consideration (money or payment of some kind) from either the conference organizer or the speaker.

Is using the word \"royalty\" especially important in this case, or is there a benign word that could be used that is not associated with copyrights? Does the specificity of these payments agreements affect copyright ownership?\n* Explicit written contracts often include a perpetuating allowance that sales may continue indefinitely so long as the \"royalty payments are met on time\".

One of the big problems of this older vendor based system is that it only communicated out on its interfaces in the vendors proprietary format. Many other systems and vendor systems interfacing to this were tightly coupled to the vendor product because they were programmed to talk in a proprietary format. One of the design principles I am adhering to here is that interfacing systems not talk in any proprietary format to the new system.\n\n\n*Related: [Is it legal to write software to convert data from a proprietary format?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8277/is-it-legal-to-write-software-to-convert-data-from-a-proprietary-format) I was told from management that Legal has in writing, explicit permission from the new vendor that we are allowed to convert their proprietary XML formats into another data format.*\n\n\nThe new software system is also a vendor product which in turn has its own vendor proprietary formats. The project is not doing so hot at the moment and we are not likely to meet our dates. Project managers are trying to convince me and the developers that they can save time by simply removing the namespace declarations of the proprietary XML formatted messages, and that by doing so that the document no longer declares its namespace thus cannot actually be considered in the proprietary format.\n\n\nI don't have the authority to say for sure that the PM is incorrect, however I know for a fact the PM has no authority to make that assertion. I do have the authority to say that XML messages they transform from proprietary must have a declared namespace meaning that they have to transform the message into some format that is distinctly different.\n\n\nThe PM is now trying to ask me what are the minimum possible changes and transformations required to where we can no longer consider the resulting message to be proprietary.\n\n\nIs there in fact a black and white answer for these sorts of things or is it like most things in Law where it is incomprehensibly a gray area?

{"text":"Is it legal in California to require extra behavior/communication from a single employee?\n*Apologies if this is not the right forum for this question. Please feel free to close if it should be asked elsewhere.*\n\n\nI was recently terminated from employment due to poor performance. About a year ago, my mother passed away, and the psychological trauma was extreme. I already suffer from clinical chronic depression, and this even took a toll on me.\n\n\nFor a six-month period, there were several instances where I missed work without notice. Admittedly, I could have communicated an out-of-office status, but my depression seemed to overwhelm me to a point where it was difficult to communicate. Upon a conversation with my manager, I communicated that I understood the need/requirement of communication, and I began seeking intense therapy (both alone and with group support) on Mondays. My employer made accommodations to this and allowed me to work only Tuesday-Thursday.\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was asked by my manager when Mondays were going to be available again, and I was told my team/colleagues were feeling a lack of cohesion with the team on my part. I told her I'm still working through this loss and therapy has been immensely helpful, but she pushed the cohesion issue again. I felt guilted/pressured into willfully terminating my Monday therapy.\n\n\nA month ago, I accidentally only requested 2 days of PTO (in our PTO system) for a trip to celebrate my mother's passing. I communicated effectively with the team that I would be gone for three days, and they even marked it appropriately in our team-level capacity sheet.\n\n\nI was confronted two weeks ago by my manager stating that I am not communicating well enough with my team, and that no one was aware of this extra day. To that end, I was given an ultimatum.\n\n\nI was told I had to perform the following tasks every day:\n\n\n* An end-of-day status, consisting of what I planned to accomplish today, what I actually accomplished, and plans for the next day\n* Attendance to all scheduled meetings, unless I was sick.\n* In our team chat software (Slack), I must \"@here\" anytime I was away from the keyboard, or send an e-mail to all team members. @here sends a notification to all team members' screens in case they have the software minimized.\n\n\nEach of these things are not required by any other team member. While I don't mind guided direction to regain team cohesion, these requests--especially the \"@here\" portion, felt extremely degrading, especially if I just had to use the restroom.

{"text":"Ask people for WhatsApp address book consent; what to do when declined?\nI have first posted this question on *Super User*. Since I tagged it with Android (as I use WhatsApp on Android) it got migrated to *Android Enthusiasts*. There one decided that it was not on-topic for that site and got closed. This question does address the technical side of uploading only a partial address book, but it mainly focuses on the legal perspective. So perhaps it is on-topic here.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nA year ago I gave into the nagging and started to use WhatsApp. With the recent update I have agree to new terms of use which contain this (italic emphasis mine):\n\n\n\n> \n> **Address Book.** You provide us the phone numbers of WhatsApp users and your other contacts in your mobile phone address book on a regular basis. You confirm *you are authorized to provide us such numbers* to allow us to provide our Services.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSo in principle I would have to send a message to each and every one of my contacts in order to ask. And while I am at it, I would actually also ask for Telegram, Hangouts, Wire, Skype, Duo, Signal; perhaps just a general authorization would be the easiest.\n\n\nThen I get back a bunch of messages which I archive somewhere securely in care somebody sues me about it. Then I can prove that they gave me permission to upload their contact details. This is just tedious and a lot of work, but technically it can be done.\n\n\nWhat do I do about the people who do not agree? Android 6.0 on my phone does not seem to allow to give only selected contacts to WhatsApp. This means that I would have to delete the number on my phone which sounds utterly inconvenient. My contacts are stored in my Google account. Should I have asked my contacts for that already?\n\n\nIs there anything I can actually do about this? I think my options are the following:\n\n\n1. Continue to use WhatsApp (like virtually everyone else) and ignore that I could potentially be sued by somebody who would not consent to his contact information being uploaded.\n\n\nAs I am a German citizen living in Germany, I am not sure where I would be sued, actually. WhatsApp has no department in Germany, so the US law covers my relationship with WhatsApp. Can another German citizen sue with under US law in Germany? Can only US citizens sue me, would I have to fly to the US? All in all it seems like a non-issue in personal life.\n2. Delete the WhatsApp account (if possible) and not use the service any more. In principle I would have to get rid of all the other messaging apps as well. I couldn't store my contact list in my Google account then either, right? That is also sharing the data with other people.\n3. Attempt to ask every one of my 532 contacts whether it is okay to upload their phone number. Otherwise delete the phone number or the whole contact from my address book. Keep track of these numbers in a paper notebook at home (in a safe).\n\n\nMy actual question: Is the third option actually possible?

{"text":"Using Wikipedia Text in a Video Game Copyright Issues?\nI am creating a game that has a great deal of items in the game. For these items I wanted to add some \"educational\" pop-up text when players hover over a certain item in the game.

Should I just do my own independent research on the each subject and put all of the descriptions in my own words?\n\n\nAlso I plan to sell this game commercially, so I do not wish to make my game freely available obviously. Also I plan to have hundreds, even thousands of objects in the game, and doing research for each one is a great deal more time to come up with a paragraph or two for each object. I am just trying to see if I can avoid that, as my time doing actual game development is much more beneficial. \n\n\nI have no problem giving the citation credits for each passage as in the image.

{"text":"What is considered sufficient evidence to prove the usage of unlicenced software?\nIt is well known that some software products \"call home\" to inform their distributors how the software is used and whether it conforms to their licensing terms. \n\n\nWhen someone pirates that software, this method might be used by the copyright holder to gather information about the user, and send the user a warning/threatening letter about the fact, and ask for payment, threatening legal action in case of non-compliance.\n\n\nHowever, **what is considered sufficient evidence for that legal action to have any standing at all?** Would the word of the copyright holder (and their server logs, which in theory could be faked) be enough to prosecute the supposed copyright infringement?\n\n\nMy misunderstanding might come from the problem of what this evidence consists of. It is just a message sent by a software to their server. It's just data somewhere on a machine, under full control of the copyright owner.\n\n\n**A)** Is the copyright owner implicitly believed? In this case it would be easy for such a company to go rogue, and make up copyright claims. For example, they might allow a free (as in beer) software to be downloaded, but having an expensive, non-free software too. The user installs the free one, it \"phones home\" with information to identify the user with, they edit the logs, and sue the user for using the non-free version.\n\n\n**B)** If the data gathered by the copyright owner is not implicitly believed, then how can they press their claim if the user denies everything? By the time they obtain a warrant and show up with the police to search the premises of the supposed pirate, the evidence might have long since been destroyed. (and usually it's in a different country, making the process even more difficult and expensive)\n\n\nIf it's (A), how are users protected from frivolous lawsuits? If it's (B), then how can copyright owners exercise any of their rights? I would guess it's mostly (B), and the copyright owners just scare users into paying, and if a users refuses, there is not much they can do against him, besides threatening to start a lengthy and expensive lawsuit which the copyright owners have no real hope of winning, but would be so costly and time-consuming for the user (especially if the user is a private person or a much smaller company than the copyright holder) that he rather pays than to be dragged into it.\n\n\nIs my understanding correct, is this how it works? The copyright holder has little to no chance of winning, but proposes a settlement of a few hundred or few thousand $, and threatens a lengthy legal process for maybe millions if not complied, and the users are scared of that lengthy process and they rather pay the smaller sum instead of going for the very low risk of having to pay millions in legal fees?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/1448","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":3,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9659152626991272}}

{"text":"Transcribing Ancient Manuscripts from Around the World\nAs a follow-up/clarification to [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33113/are-you-allowed-to-transcribe-a-copyrighted-manuscript/33137#33137), I would like to ask with a little bit more detail.\n\n\nThere are several groups of \"ancient\" manuscripts and inscriptions which I would like for this to take into account. Here is a list of some of them:\n\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre-copyright era, like 1000+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post-copyright-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright-free artifact (since it was created pre-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/1456","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":6,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9313434958457947}}

Outside of sex tourism of individuals under the age of 18 are there other situations where one can be punished for traveling to another country to commit a crime? If so are these specific laws that address only a few unique situations, or is there some general law that addresses many crimes committed by traveling to another country?\n\n\nI can think of a number of theoretical odd situations as fodder for story telling, I'll likely ask a few of them in more detail in later questions depending on the answer in this one. If someone wants to touch briefly on a few odd situations below in their answer I would be interested, but if any of these situations is too complex I'll ask them as a later follow up question.\n\n\n1. how does dual citizenship work in situations where it would be illegal for a US citizen to travel to country X to do activity Y, but the individual in question is not only a US citizen but also a citizen of X?\n2. How much does 'premeditation' apply to these rules? For instance my quick scanning of sex tourism law refers to an individual traveling to a country \"with the intent to ...\", does that mean if someone travels to a country and only then decides to do an activity it would be legal (ignoring the difficulty of proving it wasn't premeditated)?\n3.

The order requires utilities to file tariffs prohibiting monitoring unless notice is given to the parties to the conversation, or their consent is obtained. If a telephone company learns that a customer is monitoring conversations in violation of the tariff, the order requires the utility to discontinue service if the customer does not refrain from such monitoring within five days after notice from the utilities.

So long as he did nothing to induce or encourage it,10 the law allowed the seller to take advantage of the buyer's mis\n>  take of fact.

{"text":"GDPR: are faces always considered identifiable information?\nMachine learning research into facial recognition and processing (e.g. emotion detection) often makes use of datasets containing large numbers of facial images. These are usually anonymised, so that the only other information contained is the file name(s) - such as `00001.jpg`. How does GDPR affect the storage, processing, and sharing of such data?\n\n\nFor the sake of argument and to gain clarification of position, I would like to leave aside the provisions within GDPR that provide for processing data as scientific research. I am also working under the assumption that there is no other meta-data, such as a spreadsheet that links image filenames to the person depicted. \n\n\nGDPR makes clear ([Recital 26](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)) that anonymous data is not covered by the regulations:\n\n\n\n> \n> “… The principles of data protection should [therefore] not apply to\n>  anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an\n>  identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\n>  anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer\n>  identifiable.”\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nData protection considerations would be significantly reduced if these datasets were considered out of scope of GDPR. Is it possible, however, for a face image in isolation to be considered truly anonymised? It would always be feasible to link it to a real person, because most people are capable of recognising faces. With the image, and the person standing in a crowd, it is likely that the average viewer could identify the depicted person.\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2064","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":7,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.941764771938324}}

{"text":"How does one determine if illegal goods were accepted if an individual who has both legal and illegal source of income pays another party?\nLets say that an individual, Bob, has a regular job which covers his daily expenses, but also has an illegal side job. A decent percentage of his disposable income is due to Bob's illegal activities, but he has some disposable income coming from his legal activities. Both sources of income are placed into a bank, and bob then makes payments using a credit/debit card.\n\n\nI'm wondering where the line is drawn for stating that someone has received illegal goods, as there is no longer a way to tell what money was legally earned and what was illegally earned. I'm wondering both in cases in which one is aware of bobs illegal activities and in cases where the receiver of the money does not know it's illegal, but could still be compelled to refund it if it were illegally obtained.\n\n\nA few examples of the ambiguous situations I can think of:\n\n\nI assume if Bob buys a single drink at a local bar this would not be ruled as spending illegal money and the bar would not be committing an offense even if the owner of the bar was aware that Bob had an illegal income source, as Bob could easily purchase a drink with his legal income.\n\n\nLikewise I assume if bob goes out to buy a Yacht that he could never afford with his legal income it would be considered to be purchased with illegal profits.\n\n\nHowever, what about a more ambiguous case. If bob buys an expensive fur coat for someone, which he could afford to do with his legal income, but which he likely wouldn't have chosen to spend money on if he didn't have the additional illegal income, does the coat count as profiting from illegal goods? \n\n\nWhat if Bob offers a smaller sum of money to many people, small enough that Bob could easily afford to give such a gift to one person, but the combined cost of so many small gifts adds up to an amount bob couldn't/wouldn't have been able to afford without his supplementary income? Could someone argue that the gift they received from Bob came from his legal income, but the other gifts Bob made to others was due to Bob's illegal activities, by claiming Bob was likely to give a gift to them without the extra illegal income but not to the others etc?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2082","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":4,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9938932061195374}}

Suppose a person puts an obscene story on a website (we'll call them the Writer) and another person reads the story (we'll call them the Reader). \n\n\nIs the Reader guilty of 'publishing' the material and therefore in breach of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act?\n\n\nIn the normal sense, 'publication' is defined in an online context as \n\n\n\"*to submit (content) online*, as to a message board or blog: I published a comment on her blog post with examples from my own life.\" \naccording to www.dictionary.com (emphasis added is mine). \n\n\nIn the context of the Obscene Publications Act, the word 'publishes' seems to have been redefined, appropriated to become a piece of legalese that no longer reflects the original meaning of the word.

Regina vs Waddon has shown that transmission is said to have occurred when the data is uploaded to the Website by the Author or downloaded from the Website by the Reader. In both those instances, the Author was deemed to have 'published' the article.

{"text":"Can the deliberate withholding of sex constitute coercive and controlling behaviour under English & Welsh law?\nFirst I should clarify that this question is (fortunately) entirely hypothetical and academic, so please don't worry about me (I'm fine).\n\n\nI am trying to figure out a seeming conflict in the broad remit of coercive and controlling behaviour (as defined in the [The Serious Crime Act 2015)](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/section/76/enacted#moreResourcesTabHelp) and the principle of sexual consent. Though the newness of the offence means there aren't many cases on the subject, the [guidance from the Cheshire Police](https://www.cheshire.police.uk/advice-and-support/domestic-abuse/recognising-the-signs-of-domestic-abuse/), though hardly legally binding, indicates that it would be a crime to withhold affection in an attempt to punish one's partner.\n\n\nIndeed, it's easy to see how, in colloquial rather than legal terms, deliberately withholding sex could be an attempt to coerce one's partner, and abusive. The linked definition in the Serious Crime Act covers any behaviour designed to have a serious coercive or controlling effect on their partner, which is so extremely broad that deliberately withholding sex as coercive quasi-blackmail clearly seems to qualify.\n\n\nYet, accepting that this abusive behaviour constitutes a crime would suggest that people in a relationship are obliged to periodically have sex, even if one of the people wishes not to (albeit for malicious reasons). That would be repugnant, and undo the precedent of R v R [1991] UKHL 12, which clarified (shockingly late) that marital rape is a crime in England and Wales.\n\n\nLeaving aside the practical objection that the Crown would be unlikely to find a prosecution for just withholding sex as in the public interest, in this conflict of laws, which \"wins\"? Both outcomes seem unappealing: one lets off emotional abusers and the other forces people to have sex against their will.\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2177","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":3,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9544999003410339}}

Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...\n\n\nHowever, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen. She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.\n\n\nFederal law states [it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html)\n\n\nI'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).\n\n\n1. Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship\n\n\nIf the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:\n\n\n\t* Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.\n\t* Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.\n\t* Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago\n\t* Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.\n2. Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.\n\n\nWould Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: \n\n\n\t* The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home\n\t* The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship?\n\t* Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)\n\t* Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.\n\n\nI realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason. I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right? That's something I really didn't need to know about. I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...\n\n\npps. Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2233","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":8,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.979271650314331}}

{"text":"Is it legal to have a \"Create custom x\" in your D&D program, if that can result in the enduser violating the copyright?\nFirst an introduction to what i am doing! I am creating a tool for players and DMs of D&D. The reason i've been trying to understand the copyright law in regards to this issue is that upon using any information from the books created by WotC you'd violate their copyright. Luckily, WotC has a \"Open Gaming License\" that you can use, to have much of the rules, items and monsters in your book, program, etc. for free (Link to the link of the SRD-OGL: <http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd>)\n\n\nMy issue is that WotC has intentionally left out some of the unique monsters that they themselves has created over the years. Which in itself is fine, but i have no idea if i would violate their copyright for these unique monsters if i were to create a module in my program where the enduser would be able to build a custom monster from a blank template (name: input here, armor class: input here etc. - you can look at an example on, say, page 279 with the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Here name would be Tyrannosaurus Rex and Armor class would be 13 (natural armor))\n\n\nIf the enduser were to create a totally custom, madeup creature i'd imagine that tool would be fine, but i can also see the scenario where a enduser could copy letter for letter the information of a copyrighted monster into my custom monster template and essentially adding a copyright-violating item into the program.\n\n\nSo. I guess in essence what i am asking is: By making a tool in my program that can enable the user to create their own monsters, will i then be in trouble because i've also, if the user is malicious, by extension enabled the user to violate the copyright of WotC?\n\n\nI am from Denmark if that makes any difference, which i'd guess it doesn't. \nI have no real legal experience which is why i thought it'd be a good place to ask such a question.

{"text":"Can a business unilaterally change a contract?\nSuppose a customer enters into a lease- or subscription-type agreement with a business, where the business either provides a physical thing that the customer takes and uses, or the business does a thing for the customer such as mows the lawn every other week, or provides the customer with remote access to something such as internet access, web service hosting, or some online content-access service: the point is that the customer need never see or interact with any person from the business, after the agreement is reached. What passes for a written agreement simply states that the business provides that access or use of the thing to the customer for 1 year, and the customer pays a specified fee which is due up front (and was paid). There is, in particular, no clause allowing either party to terminate the contract with or without a refund (pro-rated or otherwise), no clause allows either party to unilaterally change the terms of the agreement, and no clause requires the parties to renegotiate if one side wants something.\n\n\nHowever, there is also nothing that *prohibits* one party from attempting to modify the terms of the agreement. The business could propose a new term in the contract, and the customer might accept that term. I am interested in the case where the business sets forth a new term, and the customer is not interested. The customer might explicitly reject the new term; if he does not explicitly reject the term, and also does not explicitly accept it, does silence have the same effect as explicit rejection? To be concrete about the new term, assume that it is a clause about the agreement and not the service, so for example a mandatory arbitration clause, a waiver of liability, or a non-disparagement clause.\n\n\nIn this scenario, the customer has a continuing right to that service, and by accessing the web site, using the equipment or allowing the mowers to mow the lawn as usual, it is reasonable to assume that they are simply exercising their rights under the old contract, and have not implicitly accepted the new terms. On the other hand, it might not be inconceivable that the courts have discovered an obligation to explicitly respond, whereby failing to reject is as good as accepting. Is it a clearly settled matter of law how silence along with continued use of the paid-for service is treated? (I’m looking for a leading case citation: US law if there's a difference between US and the rest of the common law world).\n\n\nThere is a general [Prescott v. Jones](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3574312/prescott-v-jones/), 41 A. 352 (N.H. 1898), exemplified in insurance contracts, that\n\n\n\n> \n> it is well settled that \"a party cannot, by the wording of his offer,\n>  turn the absence of communication of acceptance into an acceptance,\n>  and compel the recipient of his offer to refuse it at the peril of\n>  being held to have accepted it\"\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThere is a realm of \"exceptions\" with [National Union Fire Insurance v. Ehrlich](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/2161), where an insurance contract had ended and the company sent a renewal offer along with a bill (which was 2 months later rejected). The court ruled in favor of the company, citing Williston On Contracts:\n\n\n\n> \n> Generally speaking an offeree has a right to make no reply to offers.\n>  But the relations between the parties may have been such as to have\n>  justified the offeror in expecting a reply. *When property is sent to\n>  another though not ordered but under such circumstances that the\n>  latter knows that payment is expected, the silent acceptance of the\n>  property is in effect an assent to the offer of sale implied by the\n>  sending of the property*.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nSee also [Austin v. Burge, 137 S.W. 618](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/2155) for renewal of a newspaper subscription. These kinds of cases fall outside of the scope of this question, for two reasons. First, they involve a customer using the service when they have no existing contractual right to do so, second, automatic renewals are commonplace and to be expected, whereas one party unilaterally changing a contract is not at all commonplace. In the situation covered by the question, the customer is still within the period of the existing contract. \n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2348","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":2,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9592772126197815}}

{"text":"Could asking an author for a copy of their research article be illegal?\nI've been following [an interesting Twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/710834488645816321) which raised the idea that merely *asking* a researcher for a copy of a paper they've written could be against the law. From the linked tweet:\n\n\n\n> \n> you would be soliciting the violation of the law by requesting access to a copyrighted work\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nI guess the argument is the following: in the process of publication, authors typically transfer ownership of the copyright in their paper to the publishing journal. Sometimes the copyright transfer agreement specifies that the author retains the right to distribute copies of the paper, and sometimes it does not. If the agreement does not have this provision, it is being argued that asking the author for something they do not have the right to distribute could be contributory copyright infringement. Especially if you (the requesting third party) know - or believe - that the author doesn't have the right to redistribute the paper. It's worth noting here that most publishers put the standard copyright transfer agreement they ask authors to sign on their website, and authors are typically somewhat familiar with the standard agreements used by the journals they read and publish in.\n\n\nThis sounds rather crazy. I find it hard to believe that a simple informal request (which the author is free to deny, of course) could be against the law. Then again, that doesn't keep it from being true.\n\n\nI'm sure it will take a court to definitively decide this issue, but I want to ask here, is it even *plausible* that making such a request would, in fact, be found to constitute contributory copyright infringement or some other violation of that nature? Or is there no realistic way it would happen? I'm especially interested in answers that can cite relevant references, statute or case law or whatever, that would likely influence the decision in a hypothetical case testing the issue. As far as I know this has never actually come up in a case, so there may not be much to cite, but if there is, it would be a very satisfying answer. This question is as much about supporting the answer as it is about getting one in the first place.\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2355","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":16,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9671205878257751}}

Ethical hackers and professional security researchers typically report these vulnerabilities to the developer, so that they can be fixed. But companies like Zerodium buy these exploits and resell them to somebody else, we don't know who exactly. These people who buy the exploits from Zerodium are not going to use them legally, because as far as I know there is no reasonable way to use a zero-day exploit legally, other than reporting it to the developer (which they are not doing).

{"text":"Contract necessary for the most basic processing under GPDR?\nI am very pleased to have found this resource and am hoping I can be guided to some clarity on some points regarding processing of webserver access logs. I have not yet found these addressed here or elsewhere.\n\n\nMy partner and I host a number of websites for a range of clients. For some of those clients we consider we do not process any personal data - we set no cookies, use no analytics services, collect no data from the user via forms, and so on. We do however collect IP addresses in our webserver access logs.\n\n\nIt is clear from all I have read (particularly re *Patrick Breyer vs Germany*) that we need to consider IP addresses as personal data, however I have read (I have sadly mislayed the source) that the CJEU considered there were legitimate cybersecurity interests for recording them (though see comment below).\n\n\n**My query:**\nCollection of IP addresses in access logs is noted as normal operations for a web host, and GDPR outlines provisions for doing so to maintain security and investigate breaches. But because IP addresses are personal data, do we now need to create a new contract to outline how we will use this data?\n\n\n**Additional info:**\nI see from this resource that Article 11 has a provision for my query:\n\n\nArticle 11 (1) \"Where, in cases referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, the controller shall inform the data subject accordingly, if possible. In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\"\n\n\n<http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-11-processing-which-does-not-require-identification-GDPR.htm>\n\n\nThis though would not exempt us or the Controller from having a contract for the collection of the IP address (unusable as it is for identifying a person, but recognised in law as personal data).\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2398","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":5,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9375348687171936}}

I've recently run into a major German ISP blocking my site (this is a new thing; I used to send to their customers with no problem) and interrupting communication with one of their customers I need to correspond with.\n\n\nAfter a few weeks of back-and-forth with their email engineering contact giving me moving-goalposts/bait-and-switch about what they want me to do to get unblocked from their system, they are now insisting that I publish legal name and physical street address for the responsible party (that would be me personally) on the web as a condition to access their service.\n\n\nIs this sort of requirement legal under the GDPR? I could understand (while strongly objecting to, but that's not part of the legal question here) \"sorry, we won't open our service to you\", but making an offer to provide access but making it conditional on what amounts to doxing oneself seems like it should not be legal. Is this (demanding I publish it publicly rather than give them the same information privately) some loophole for skirting around the GDPR? Is there anything else legally sketchy about the demand?\n\n\nI am not in Germany; the other party involved is.\n\n\nMore details copied from clarifying comments I posted on an answer (sorry, some of this is technical and may not be useful to non-IT folks):\n\n\n\n> \n> The data was requested after a long series of individual email exchanges with their email engineering department (which has its own separate mail system that's not blocking my site). No emails were flagged as spam and no spam has ever been sent from my site to their mail system. (Fewer than 50 total emails have ever been sent from my site to them.) They seem to have instituted their own in-house policy for IP addresses to accept from based on IP block ownership data (note: not using any of the well-run RBL/DUL type lists) and allow-listing well-known sites.\n> \n> \n> Rejection takes place before the SMTP session even begins (error message prior to EHLO, giving the address of the email engineering department which I then contacted). Initial request was that I provide \"full contact info\" on webserver associated with domain the IP address reverses to in order to be unblocked, with no indication of what that would entail. Eventually after being (apparently intentionally) vague for a long time they started insisting that include physical street address. \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nBasically, the actionable thing I want to know is whether I have grounds to say something like \"The offer to accept mail from my site under the conditions of having published physical contact information constitutes a solicitation for personal data protected by GDPR, and if you are soliciting such personal data, you are required by law to accept it via a secure and private channel.\"\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2454","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":6,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9688544869422913}}

Jane is the girlfriend of Jesse and Walter doesn't like that, since he thinks she could be an obstacle to their business.

Walter tries to wake up Jesse shaking him strongly without success. Doing that he modified slightly the position of Jessie and a conseguence (since she was in a sort of hug with him) Jane. In particular now she is on her back. It is not clear if she had a pillow on her back to avoid this position. Some time before, Jesse had explained to Walter that in this situation the pillow is important, since it keeps you on your side and not in your back, so if you vomit you avoid choking to death.

At first Walter tries to react, running to the other side of the bed to help her, but then he stops and decides to do nothing as she dies.\n\n\nWhat is this? Homicide? Voluntary?

{"text":"Would police in the US have any alternative for handling a confiscated computer with a hidden partition?\nI've heard some fellow geeks (who are always obsessed with computer privacy) talk about how 'amazing' a hidden partition is for privacy. I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2517","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":4,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9745001196861267}}

Featuring posts is a responsibility of moderators, who represent the community, not the company, so I don't think there is a risk of treating the post (or its being featured) as a statement coming from company. So what concerns might be present here?\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2528","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":8,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9175593256950378}}

{"text":"Is it legal to create an app, that \"streams\" a specific game from a website?\nIt's hard to tell what I mean in just one sentence. For example: If I would create a mobile JnR-App, with Super Mario Textures, Nintendo can sue me. But now, for another example let's take \"Gravity Guy\" by Miniclip. There is no mobile app for the current operating systems, last time it has been updated 6 years ago and now you can't play it on newer phones. But you still can play the game at their Website for free.\n\n\nNow what if I create an Application, that uses a web-browser engine to \"stream\" the game, so you can play it. The website gets cut off, only the game is visible. Could Miniclip sue me for that?\n\n\nI don't talk about other things like a name for the app. If I would call it \"Gravity Guy\", they can sue me, I mean the specific scenario \"The app connects to Miniclip and opens the game in fullscreen, so I can play it\". While connecting and opening, the user only sees a Loading-screen\n\n\nEDIT: With streaming, I just mean that a javascript game you normally have in your browser gets displayed in fullscreen on your phone. The game is not by me, but as the app is just a browser for it, it shouldn't be illegal I think\n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2533","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":2,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.961042582988739}}

Most of what I can find in a Google search seems to come from entities pushing a commercial solution for GDPR in apps, and other snippets that don't look applicable or are just an over-the-top compliance advice. \n\n\nI am a one person LLC entity, about to push out a free app, mostly to demonstrate my Swift coding ability.

{"text":"misdemeanor complaint, state requested release conditions, discovery evidence\nI was charged with a misdemeanor, but the court messed up and sent the misdemeanor complaint to a wrong address. Never receiving it, never appearing at the court, they then created a warrant for my arrest, which they sent to my correct address, and I did receive, with $1000 bail amount. I then appeared in court, showed the judge the court messed up (the court found their letters to a wrong address), and she quashed the warrant and removed any bail payment. However she gave me various release conditions, removing various rights (e.g. no firearms). I then asked the judge, if you remove these rights, can you show me the basis for the charges, the discovery evidence against me. She could not, and had no idea of how to get it, even stating this is an unusual request. Perhaps this is because of the way their address mess-up resulted in a warrant for my arrest. To me this is wrong -- my rights should not be removed in a situation like this, alleged harassment, without providing me any evidence against me.\n\n\nMy question is, how would it have gone differently if they sent the misdemeanor complaint to my correct address, and I appeared, and the state had requested certain release conditions while filing the complaint (which they did, at time of filing the complaint). What typically happens at the first appearance of a complaint? Are they allowed to remove your rights, without providing you any discovery evidence? \n\n\n--- I added two comments, that ideally help advance the discussion --- \n\n\n","id":"law_stack_exchange.jsonl/2540","metadata":{"source":"law_stack_exchange","score":2,"file_path":"/Users/adrienloizeau/dev/scratchGPT/data/law_stack_exchange.jsonl","language":"en","language_score":0.9766520261764526}}
{"text":"Is it legal to include verbatim exercises from a book in videos/on a blog?\nI live in Florida, U.S. I recently purchased a math book that I really like, and I am thinking about making a video series or a blog where I would succcessively resolve the exercises from the book.\n\n\nOf course, to do so, I would have to reproduce the problem statements in their entirety.
